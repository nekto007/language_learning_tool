      <p>“YOU FEEL THIS BOOK</p>

      <p>—Kansas City Star</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>Tired of weeding peas at a penal farm, the tough, freewheeling McMurphy feigns insanity for a</p>
      <p>chance  at  the  softer  life  of  a  mental  institution.  But  he  gets  more  than  he’s  bargained  for,  much</p>
      <p>more. He is committed to the care of Big Nurse—a full-breasted, stiff-gaited tyrant who rules over</p>
      <p>her charges with chilling authority.</p>
      <p>Her ward is a citadel of discipline. Strong-arm orderlies stand ready to quell even the feeblest insurrection. Her</p>
      <p>patients  long  ago  gave  up  the  struggle  to  assert  themselves.  Cowed,  docile,  they  have  surrendered  completely  to  her</p>
      <p>unbridled authority.</p>
      <p>Now, into their ranks charges McMurphy. The gambling Irishman sees at once what Big Nurse’s</p>
      <p>game is. Appalled by the timidity of his fellow patients, he begins his one man campaign to render</p>
      <p>her powerless. First in fun, and then in dire earnestness, he sets out to create havoc on her well-run</p>
      <p>ward ... to make the gray halls ring with laughter, and anger, and life.</p>

      </p><p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>1</p>
      <p>They’re out there.</p>
      <p>Black  boys  in  white  suits  up  before  me  to  commit  sex  acts  in  the  hall  and  get  it  mopped  up</p>
      <p>before I can catch them.</p>
      <p>They’re mopping when I come out the dorm, all three of them sulky and hating everything, the</p>
      <p>time of day, the place they’re at here, the people they got to work around. When they hate like this,</p>
      <p>better  if  they  don’t  see  me.  I  creep  along  the  wall  quiet  as  dust  in  my  canvas  shoes,  but  they  got</p>
      <p>special sensitive equipment detects my fear and they all look up, all three at once, eyes glittering out</p>
      <p>of the black faces like the hard glitter of radio tubes out of the back of an old radio.</p>
      <p>“Here’s the Chief. The soo-pah Chief, fellas. Ol’ Chief Broom. Here you go, Chief Broom. ...”</p>
      <p>Stick a mop in my hand and motion to the spot they aim for me to clean today, and I go. One</p>
      <p>swats the backs of my legs with a broom handle to hurry me past.</p>
      <p>“Haw, you look at ‘im shag it? Big enough to eat apples off my head an’ he mine me like a baby.”</p>
      <p>[10] They laugh and then I hear them mumbling behind me, heads close together. Hum of black</p>
      <p>machinery, humming hate and death and other hospital secrets. They don’t bother not talking out</p>
      <p>loud about their hate secrets when I’m nearby because they think I’m deaf and dumb. Everybody</p>
      <p>thinks so. I’m cagey enough to fool them that much. If my being half Indian ever helped me in any</p>
      <p>way in this dirty life, it helped me being cagey, helped me all these years.</p>
      <p>I’m mopping near the ward door when a key hits it from the other side and I know it’s the Big</p>
      <p>Nurse by the way the lockworks cleave to the key, soft and swift and familiar she been around locks</p>
      <p>so long. She slides through the door with a gust of cold and locks the door behind her and I see her</p>
      <p>fingers trail across the polished steel—tip of each finger the same color as her lips. Funny orange.</p>
      <p>Like  the  tip  of  a  soldering  iron.  Color  so  hot  or  so  cold  if  she  touches  you  with  it  you  can’t  tell</p>
      <p>which.</p>
      <p>She’s  carrying  her  woven  wicker  bag  like  the  ones  the  Umpqua  tribe  sells  out  along  the  hot</p>
      <p>August highway, a bag shape of a tool box with a hemp handle. She’s had it all the years I been here.</p>
      <p>It’s a loose weave and I can see inside it; there’s no compact or lipstick or woman stuff, she’s got</p>
      <p>that bag full of thousand parts she aims to use in her duties today—wheels and gears, cogs polished</p>
      <p>to  a  hard  glitter,  tiny pills  that  gleam  like  porcelain,  needles,  forceps,  watchmakers’  pliers,  rolls  of</p>
      <p>copper wire …</p>
      <p>She dips a nod at me as she goes past. I let the mop push me back to the wall and smile and try</p>
      <p>to  foul  her  equipment’  up  as  much  as  possible  by  not  letting  her  see  my  eyes—they  can’t  tell  so</p>
      <p>much about you if you got your eyes closed.</p>
      <p>In my dark I hear her rubber heels hit the tile and the stuff in her wicker bag clash with the jar of</p>
      <p>her walking as she passes me in the hall. She walks stiff. When I open my eyes she’s down the hall</p>
      <p>about to turn into the glass Nurses’ Station where she’ll spend the day sitting at her desk and looking</p>
      <p>out her window and making notes on what goes on out in front of her in the day room during the</p>
      <p>next eight hours. Her face looks pleased and peaceful with the thought.</p>
      <p>Then … she sights those black boys. They’re still down there together, mumbling to one another.</p>
      <p>They didn’t hear her come on the ward. They sense she’s glaring down at them now, but it’s too late.</p>
      <p>They  should  of  knew better’n  to  group  up  and  mumble  together  when  she  was  due  on  the  ward.</p>
      <p>Their faces bob apart, confused. She goes into a crouch and advances on where they’re trapped in a</p>
      <p>huddle at the end of the corridor. [11] She knows what they been saying, and I can see she’s furious</p>
      <p>clean out of control. She’s going to tear the black bastards limb from limb, she’s so furious. She’s</p>
      <p>swelling up, swells till her back’s splitting out the white uniform and she’s let her arms section out</p>
      <p>long enough to wrap around the three of them five, six times. She looks around her with a swivel of</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>7</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>her huge head. Nobody up to see, just old Broom Bromden the half-breed Indian back there hiding</p>
      <p>behind  his  mop  and  can’t  talk  to  call  for  help.  So  she  really  lets  herself  go  and  her  painted  smile</p>
      <p>twists, stretches to an open snarl, and she blows up bigger and bigger, big as a tractor, so big I can</p>
      <p>smell the machinery inside the way you smell a motor pulling too big a load. I hold my breath and</p>
      <p>figure,  My  God  this  time  they’re  gonna  do  it!  This  time  they  let  the  hate  build  up  too  high  and</p>
      <p>overloaded and they’re gonna tear one another to pieces before they realize what they’re doing!</p>
      <p>But just as she starts crooking those sectioned arms around the black boys and they go to ripping</p>
      <p>at her underside with the mop handles, all the patients start coming out of the dorms to check on</p>
      <p>what’s the hullabaloo, and she has to change back before she’s caught in the shape of her hideous</p>
      <p>real  self.  By  the  time  the  patients  get  their  eyes  rubbed  to  where  they  can  halfway  see  what  the</p>
      <p>racket’s  about,  all  they  see  is the  head nurse,  smiling  and  calm  and  cold  as  usual,  telling  the  black</p>
      <p>boys they’d best not stand in a group gossiping when it is Monday morning and there is such a lot to</p>
      <p>get done on the first morning of the week. ...</p>
      <p>“... mean old Monday morning, you know, boys ...”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, Miz Ratched ...</p>
      <p>“... and we have quite a number of appointments this morning, so perhaps, if your standing here</p>
      <p>in a group talking isn’t too urgent ...”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, Miz Ratched ...”</p>
      <p>She stops and nods at some of the patients come to stand around and stare out of eyes all red</p>
      <p>and  puffy  with  sleep.  She  nods  once  to  each.  Precise,  automatic  gesture.  Her  face  is  smooth,</p>
      <p>calculated, and precision-made, like an expensive baby doll, skin like flesh-colored enamel, blend of</p>
      <p>white  and  cream  and  baby-blue  eyes,  small  nose,  pink  little  nostrils—everything  working  together</p>
      <p>except  the  color  on  her  lips  and  fingernails,  and  the  size  of  her  bosom.  A  mistake  was  made</p>
      <p>somehow in manufacturing, putting those big, womanly breasts on what would of otherwise been a</p>
      <p>perfect work, and you can see how bitter she is about it.</p>
      <p>The men are still standing and waiting to see what she was [12] onto the black boys about, so she</p>
      <p>remembers seeing me and says, “And since it is Monday, boys, why don’t we get a good head start</p>
      <p>on the week by shaving poor Mr. Bromden first this morning, before the after-breakfast rush on the</p>
      <p>shaving room, and see if we can’t avoid some of the—ah—disturbance he tends to cause, don’t you</p>
      <p>think?”</p>
      <p>Before anybody can turn to look for me I duck back in the mop closet, jerk the door shut dark</p>
      <p>after  me,  hold  my  breath.  Shaving  before  you  get  breakfast  is  the  worst  time.  When  you  got</p>
      <p>something under your belt you’re stronger and more wide awake, and the bastards who work for the</p>
      <p>Combine  aren’t  so  apt  to  slip  one of  their  machines  in  on  you  in  place  of  an  electric  shaver.  But</p>
      <p>when you shave before breakfast like she has me do some mornings—six-thirty in the morning in a</p>
      <p>room  all  white  walls  and  white  basins,  and  long-tube-lights  in  the  ceiling  making  sure  there  aren’t</p>
      <p>any shadows, and faces all round you trapped screaming behind the mirrors—then what chance you</p>
      <p>got against one of their machines?</p>
      <p>I hide in the mop closet and listen, my heart beating in the dark, and I try to keep from getting</p>
      <p>scared, try to get my thoughts off someplace else—try to think back and remember things about the</p>
      <p>village and the big Columbia River, think about ah one time Papa and me were hunting birds in a</p>
      <p>stand of cedar trees near The Dalles. ... But like always when I try to place my thoughts in the past</p>
      <p>and hide there, the fear close at hand seeps in through the memory. I can feel that least black boy</p>
      <p>out there coming up the hall, smelling out for my fear. He opens out his nostrils like black funnels,</p>
      <p>his outsized head bobbing this way and that as he sniffs, and he sucks in fear from all over the ward.</p>
      <p>He’s smelling me now, I can hear him snort. He don’t know where I’m hid, but he’s smelling and</p>
      <p>he’s hunting around. I try to keep still. …</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>8</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>(Papa  tells  me  to  keep  still,  tells  me  that  the  dog  senses  a  bird  somewheres  right  close.  We</p>
      <p>borrowed a pointer dog from a man in The Dalles. All the village dogs are no-‘count mongrels, Papa</p>
      <p>says, fish-gut eaters and no class a-tall; this here dog, he got insteek! I don’t say anything, but I already</p>
      <p>see  the  bird  up  in  a  scrub  cedar,  hunched  in  a  gray  knot  of  feathers.  Dog  running  in  circles</p>
      <p>underneath, too much smell around for him to point for sure. The bird safe as long as he keeps still.</p>
      <p>He’s holding out pretty good, but the dog keeps sniffing and circling, louder and closer. Then the</p>
      <p>bird breaks, feathers springing, jumps out of the cedar into the birdshot from Papa’s gun.)</p>
      <p>The least black boy and one of the bigger ones catch me [13] before I get ten steps out of the</p>
      <p>mop closet, and drag me back to the shaving room. I don’t fight or make any noise. If you yell it’s</p>
      <p>just tougher on you. I hold back the yelling. I hold back till they get to my temples. I’m not sure it’s</p>
      <p>one of those substitute machines and not a shaver till it gets to my temples; then I can’t hold back.</p>
      <p>It’s not a will-power thing any more when they get to my temples. It’s a … button, pushed, says Air</p>
      <p>Raid Air Raid, turns me on so loud it’s like no sound, everybody yelling at me, hands over their ears</p>
      <p>from behind a glass wall, faces working around in talk circles but no sound from the mouths. My</p>
      <p>sound soaks up all other sound. They start the fog machine again and it’s snowing down cold and</p>
      <p>white all over me like skim milk, so thick I might even be able to hide in it if they didn’t have a hold</p>
      <p>on me. I can’t see six inches in front of me through the fog and the only thing I can hear over the</p>
      <p>wail I’m making is the Big Nurse whoop and charge up the hall while she crashes patients outta her</p>
      <p>way with that wicker bag. I hear her coming but I still can’t hush my hollering. I holler till she gets</p>
      <p>there.  They hold me  down  while  she  jams  wicker bag  and  all  into  my  mouth  and  shoves  it  down</p>
      <p>with a mop handle.</p>
      <p>(A  bluetick  hound bays  out there  in the  fog,  running  scared  and  lost because  he  can’t  see. No</p>
      <p>tracks on the ground but the ones he’s making, and he sniffs in every direction with his cold red-</p>
      <p>rubber  nose  and  picks  up no  scent but his  own  fear,  fear burning  down  into  him  like  steam.) It’s</p>
      <p>gonna burn me just that way, finally telling about all this, about the hospital, and her, and the guys—</p>
      <p>and about McMurphy. I been silent so long now it’s gonna roar out of me like floodwaters and you</p>
      <p>think the guy telling this is ranting and raving my God; you think this is too horrible to have really</p>
      <p>happened, this is too awful to be the truth! But, please. It’s still hard for me to have a clear mind</p>
      <p>thinking on it. But it’s the truth even if it didn’t happen.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>9</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>2</p>
      <p>When the fog clears to where I can see, I’m sitting in the day room. They didn’t take me to the</p>
      <p>Shock  Shop  this  time.  I  remember  they  took  me  out  of  the  shaving  room  and  locked  me  in</p>
      <p>Seclusion.  I  don’t  remember  if  I  got  breakfast  or  not.  Probably  not.  I  can  call  to  mind  some</p>
      <p>mornings locked in Seclusion the black boys keep bringing seconds of everything—supposed to be</p>
      <p>for  me,  but  they  eat  it  instead—till  all  three  of  them  get  breakfast  while  I  lie  there  on  that  pee-</p>
      <p>stinking mattress, watching them wipe up egg with toast. I can smell the grease and hear them chew</p>
      <p>the  toast.  Other  mornings  they  bring  me  cold  mush  and  force  me  to  eat  it  without  it  even being</p>
      <p>salted.</p>
      <p>This morning I plain don’t remember. They got enough of those things they call pills down me</p>
      <p>so I don’t know a thing till I hear the ward door open. That ward door opening means it’s at least</p>
      <p>eight o’clock, means there’s been maybe an hour and a half I was out cold in that Seclusion Room</p>
      <p>when the technicians could of come in and installed anything the Big Nurse ordered and I wouldn’t</p>
      <p>have the slightest notion what.</p>
      <p>I hear noise at the ward door, off up the hall out of my sight. That ward door starts opening at</p>
      <p>eight and opens and closes a thousand times a day, kashash, click. Every morning we sit lined up on</p>
      <p>each side of the day room, mixing jigsaw puzzles after breakfast, listen for a key to hit the lock, and</p>
      <p>wait to see what’s coming in. There’s not a whole lot else to do. Sometimes, at the door, it’s a young</p>
      <p>resident in early so he can watch what we’re like Before Medication. BM, they call it. Sometimes it’s a</p>
      <p>wife visiting there on high heels with her purse held tight over her belly. Sometimes it’s a clutch of</p>
      <p>grade-school teachers being led on a tour by that fool Public Relation man who’s always clapping his</p>
      <p>wet hands together and saying how overjoyed he is that mental hospitals have eliminated all the old-</p>
      <p>fashioned  cruelty.  “What  a  cheery  atmosphere,  don’t  you  agree?”  He’ll  bustle  around  the</p>
      <p>schoolteachers, who are bunched together for safety, clapping his hands together. “Oh, when I think</p>
      <p>back on the old days, on the filth, the bad food, even, yes, brutality, oh, I realize, ladies, that we have</p>
      <p>come  a  long  way  in  our  campaign!”  Whoever  comes  in  [15]  the  door  is  usually  somebody</p>
      <p>disappointing, but there’s always a chance otherwise, and when a key hits the lock all the heads come</p>
      <p>up like there’s strings on them.</p>
      <p>This morning the lockworks rattle strange; it’s not a regular visitor at the door. An Escort Man’s</p>
      <p>voice calls down, edgy and impatient, “Admission, come sign for him,” and the black boys go.</p>
      <p>Admission.  Everybody  stops  playing  cards  and  Monopoly,  turns  toward  the  day-room  door.</p>
      <p>Most  days  I’d  be  out  sweeping  the  hall  and  see  who  they’re  signing  in,  but  this  morning,  like  I</p>
      <p>explain to you, the Big Nurse put a thousand pounds down me and I can’t budge out of the chair.</p>
      <p>Most days I’m the first one to see the Admission, watch him creep in the door and slide along the</p>
      <p>wall  and  stand  scared  till  the  black  boys  come  sign  for  him  and  take  him  into  the  shower  room,</p>
      <p>where they strip him and leave him shivering with the door open while they all three run grinning up</p>
      <p>and down the halls looking for the Vaseline. “We need that Vaseline,” they’ll tell the Big Nurse, “for</p>
      <p>the thermometer.” She looks from one to the other: “I’m sure you do,” and hands them a jar holds at</p>
      <p>least a gallon, “but mind you boys don’t group up in there.” Then I see two, maybe all three of them</p>
      <p>in there, in that shower room with the Admission, running that thermometer around in the grease</p>
      <p>till it’s coated the size of your finger, crooning, “Tha’s right, mothah, that’s right,” and then shut the</p>
      <p>door and turn all the showers up to where you can’t hear anything but the vicious hiss of water on</p>
      <p>the green tile. I’m out there most days, and I see it like that.</p>
      <p>But this morning I have to sit in the chair and only listen to them bring him in. Still, even though</p>
      <p>I can’t see him, I know he’s no ordinary Admission. I don’t hear him slide scared along the wall, and</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>10</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>when they tell him about the shower he don’t just submit with a weak little yes, he tells them right</p>
      <p>back in a loud, brassy voice that he’s already plenty damn clean, thank you.</p>
      <p>“They showered me this morning at the courthouse and last night at the jail. And I swear I believe</p>
      <p>they’d of washed my ears for me on the taxi ride over if they coulda found the vacilities. Hoo boy,</p>
      <p>seems like everytime they ship me someplace I gotta get scrubbed down before, after, and during the</p>
      <p>operation.  I’m  gettin’  so  the  sound  of  water  makes  me  start  gathering  up  my  belongings.  And  get</p>
      <p>back away from me with that thermometer, Sam, and give me a minute to look my new home over;</p>
      <p>I never been in a Institute of Psychology before.”</p>
      <p>The patients look at one another’s puzzled faces, then back [16] to the door, where his voice is</p>
      <p>still coming in. Talking louder’n you’d think he needed to if the black boys were anywhere near him.</p>
      <p>He sounds like he’s way above them, talking down, like he’s sailing fifty yards overhead, hollering at</p>
      <p>those below on the ground. He sounds big. I hear him coming down the hall, and he sounds big in</p>
      <p>the way he walks, and he sure don’t slide; he’s got iron on his heels and he rings it on the floor like</p>
      <p>horseshoes. He shows up in the door and stops and hitches his thumbs in his pockets, boots wide</p>
      <p>apart, and stands there with the guys looking at him.</p>
      <p>“Good mornin’, buddies.”</p>
      <p>There’s a paper Halloween bat hanging on a string above his head; he reaches up and flicks it so</p>
      <p>it spins around.</p>
      <p>“Mighty nice fall day.”</p>
      <p>He talks a little the way Papa used to, voice loud and full of hell, but he doesn’t look like Papa;</p>
      <p>Papa  was  a  full-blood  Columbia  Indian—a    chief—and  hard  and  shiny  as  a  gunstock.  This  guy  is</p>
      <p>redheaded with long red sideburns and a tangle of curls out from under his cap, been needing cut a</p>
      <p>long time, and he’s broad as Papa was tall, broad across the jaw and shoulders and chest, a broad</p>
      <p>white devilish grin, and he’s hard in a different kind of way from Papa, kind of the way a baseball is</p>
      <p>hard under the scuffed leather. A seam runs across his nose and one cheekbone where somebody</p>
      <p>laid him a  good one in a fight, and the stitches are still  in the seam. He stands there waiting,  and</p>
      <p>when nobody makes a move to say anything to him he commences to laugh. Nobody can tell exactly</p>
      <p>why he laughs; there’s nothing funny going on. But it’s not the way that Public Relation laughs, it’s</p>
      <p>free and loud and it comes out of his wide grinning mouth and spreads in rings bigger and bigger till</p>
      <p>it’s lapping against the walls all over the ward. Not like that fat Public Relation laugh. This sounds</p>
      <p>real. I realize all of a sudden it’s the first laugh I’ve heard in years.</p>
      <p>He stands looking at us, rocking back in his boots, and he laughs and laughs. He laces his fingers</p>
      <p>over his belly without taking his thumbs out of his pockets. I see how big and beat up his hands are.</p>
      <p>Everybody on the ward, patients, staff, and all, is stunned dumb by him and his laughing. There’s no</p>
      <p>move to stop him, no move to say anything. He laughs till he’s finished for a time, and he walks on</p>
      <p>into the day room. Even when he isn’t laughing, that laughing sound hovers around him, the way</p>
      <p>the  sound  hovers  around  a  big  bell  just  quit  ringing—it’s  in  his  eyes,  in  the  way  he  smiles  and</p>
      <p>swaggers, in the way he talks.</p>
      <p>“My name is McMurphy, buddies, R. P. McMurphy, and [17] I’m a gambling fool.” He winks and</p>
      <p>sings a little piece of a song: “ ‘... and whenever I meet with a deck a cards I lays … my money ...</p>
      <p>down,’” and laughs again.</p>
      <p>He  walks  to  one  of  the  card  games,  tips  an  Acute’s  cards  up  with  a  thick,  heavy  finger,  and</p>
      <p>squints at the hand and shakes his head.</p>
      <p>“Yessir,  that’s  what  I  came  to  this  establishment  for,  to bring  you  birds  fun  an’  entertainment</p>
      <p>around the gamin’ table. Nobody left in that Pendleton Work Farm to make my days interesting any</p>
      <p>more,  so I  requested  a  transfer,  ya  see.  Needed  some  new blood.  Hooee,  look  at the  way  this  bird</p>
      <p>holds his cards, showin’ to everybody in a block; man! I’ll trim you babies like little lambs.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>11</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>Cheswick  gathers  his  cards  together.  The  redheaded  man  sticks  his  hand  out  for  Cheswick  to</p>
      <p>shake.</p>
      <p>“Hello,  buddy;  what’s  that  you’re  playin’?  Pinochle?  Jesus,  no  wonder  you  don’t  care  nothin’</p>
      <p>about  showing  your  hand.  Don’t  you  have  a  straight  deck  around  here?  Well  say,  here  we  go,  I</p>
      <p>brought along my own deck, just in case, has something in it other than face cards—and check the</p>
      <p>pictures, huh? Every one different. Fifty-two positions.”</p>
      <p>Cheswick is pop-eyed already, and what he sees on those cards don’t help his condition.</p>
      <p>“Easy now, don’t smudge ‘em; we got lots of time, lots of games ahead of us. I like to use my</p>
      <p>deck here because it takes at least a week for the other players to get to where they can even see the</p>
      <p>suit. ...”</p>
      <p>He’s got on work-farm pants and shirt, sunned out till they’re the color of watered milk. His face</p>
      <p>and  neck  and  arms  are  the  color  of  oxblood  leather  from  working  long  in  the  fields.  He’s  got  a</p>
      <p>primer-black  motorcycle  cap  stuck  in  his  hair  and  a  leather  jacket  over  one  arm,  and  he’s  got  on</p>
      <p>boots gray and dusty and heavy enough to kick a man half in two. He walks away from Cheswick</p>
      <p>and takes off the cap and goes to beating a dust storm out of his thigh. One of the black boys circles</p>
      <p>him  with  the  thermometer,  but  he’s  too  quick  for  them;  he  slips  in  among  the  Acutes  and  starts</p>
      <p>moving around shaking hands before the black boy can take good aim. The way he talks, his wink,</p>
      <p>his loud talk, his swagger all remind me of a car salesman or a stock auctioneer—or one of those</p>
      <p>pitchmen  you  see  on  a  sideshow  stage,  out  in  front  of  his  flapping  banners,  standing  there  in  a</p>
      <p>striped shirt with yellow buttons, drawing the faces off the sawdust like a magnet.</p>
      <p>“What happened, you see, was I got in a couple of hassles at the work farm, to tell the pure truth,</p>
      <p>and the court ruled [18] that I’m a psychopath. And do you think I’m gonna argue with the court?</p>
      <p>Shoo,  you  can  bet  your  bottom  dollar  I  don’t. If  it  gets  me  outta  those  damned  pea  fields  I’ll  be</p>
      <p>whatever their little heart desires, be it psychopath or mad dog or werewolf, because I don’t care if I</p>
      <p>never see another weedin’ hoe to my dying day. Now they tell me a psychopath’s a guy fights too</p>
      <p>much and fucks too much, but they ain’t wholly right, do you think? I mean, whoever heard tell of a</p>
      <p>man gettin’ too much poozle? Hello, buddy, what do they call you? My name’s McMurphy and I’ll</p>
      <p>bet you two dollars here and now that you can’t tell me how many spots are in that pinochle hand</p>
      <p>you’re holding don’t look. Two dollars; what d’ya say? God damn, Sam! can’t you wait half a minute to</p>
      <p>prod me with that damn thermometer of yours?”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>12</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>3</p>
      <p>The new man stands looking a minute, to get the set-up of the day room.</p>
      <p>One side of the room younger patients, known as Acutes because the doctors figure them still</p>
      <p>sick  enough  to  be  fixed,  practice  arm  wrestling  and  card  tricks  where  you  add  and  subtract  and</p>
      <p>count down so many and it’s a certain card. Billy Bibbit tries to learn to roll a tailor-made cigarette,</p>
      <p>and Martini walks around, discovering things under the tables and chairs. The Acutes move around a</p>
      <p>lot. They tell jokes to each other and snicker in their fists (nobody ever dares let loose and laugh, the</p>
      <p>whole staff’d be in with notebooks and a lot of questions) and they write letters with yellow, runty,</p>
      <p>chewed pencils.</p>
      <p>They spy on each other. Sometimes one man says something about himself that he didn’t aim to</p>
      <p>let slip, and one of his buddies at the table where he said it yawns and gets up and sidles over to the</p>
      <p>big  log  book  by  the  Nurses’  Station  and  writes  down  the  piece  of  information  he  heard—of</p>
      <p>therapeutic interest to the whole ward, is what the Big Nurse says the book is for, but I know she’s</p>
      <p>just  waiting  to  get  enough  evidence  to  have  some  guy  reconditioned  at  the  Main  Building,</p>
      <p>overhauled in the head to straighten out the trouble.</p>
      <p>The guy that wrote the piece of information in the log book, he gets a star by his name on the</p>
      <p>roll and gets to sleep late the next day.</p>
      <p>Across the room from the Acutes are the culls of the Combine’s product, the Chronics. Not in</p>
      <p>the hospital,  these,  to  get  fixed, but  just  to  keep them  from  walking  around  the  streets  giving  the</p>
      <p>product a bad name. Chronics are in for good, the staff concedes. Chronics are divided into Walkers</p>
      <p>like me, can still get around if you keep them fed, and Wheelers and Vegetables. What the Chronics</p>
      <p>are—or most of us—are machines with flaws inside that can’t be repaired, flaws born in, or flaws</p>
      <p>beat in over so many years of the guy running head-on into solid things that by the time the hospital</p>
      <p>found him he was bleeding rust in some vacant lot.</p>
      <p>But there are some of us Chronics that the staff made a couple of mistakes on years back, some</p>
      <p>of us who were Acutes when we came in, and got changed over. Ellis is a Chronic [20] came in an</p>
      <p>Acute and got fouled up bad when they overloaded him in that filthy brain-murdering room that the</p>
      <p>black boys call the “Shock Shop.” Now he’s nailed against the wall in the same condition they lifted</p>
      <p>him off the table for the last time, in the same shape, arms out, palms cupped, with the same horror</p>
      <p>on his face. He’s nailed like that on the wall, like a stuffed trophy. They pull the nails when it’s time</p>
      <p>to eat or time to drive him in to bed when they want him to move so’s I can mop the puddle where</p>
      <p>he stands. At the old place he stood so long in one spot the piss ate the floor and beams away under</p>
      <p>him and he kept falling through to the ward below, giving them all kinds of census headaches down</p>
      <p>there when roll check came around.</p>
      <p>Ruckly  is another Chronic came in a few years back as an Acute, but him they overloaded in a</p>
      <p>different way: they made a mistake in one of their head installations. He was being a holy nuisance</p>
      <p>all over the place, kicking the black boys and biting the student nurses on the legs, so they took him</p>
      <p>away to be fixed. They strapped him to that table, and the last anybody saw of him for a while was</p>
      <p>just before they shut the door on him; he winked, just before the door closed, and told the black</p>
      <p>boys as they backed away from him, “You’ll pay for this, you damn tarbabies.”</p>
      <p>And they brought him back to the ward two weeks later, bald and the front of his face an oily</p>
      <p>purple bruise and two little button-sized plugs stitched one above each eye. You can see by his eyes</p>
      <p>how they burned him out over there; his eyes are all  smoked up and gray and deserted inside like</p>
      <p>blown  fuses.  All  day  now  he  won’t  do  a  thing  but  hold  an  old  photograph  up  in  front  of  that</p>
      <p>burned-out face, turning it over and over in his cold fingers, and the picture wore gray as his eyes on</p>
      <p>both sides with all his handling till you can’t tell any more what it used to be.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>13</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>The staff, now, they consider Ruckly one of their failures, but I’m not sure but what he’s better</p>
      <p>off  than  if  the  installation  had  been  perfect.  The  installations  they  do  nowadays  are  generally</p>
      <p>successful.  The  technicians  got  more  skill  and  experience.  No  more  of  the  button  holes  in  the</p>
      <p>forehead, no cutting at all—they go in through the eye sockets. Sometimes a guy goes over for an</p>
      <p>installation, leaves the ward mean and mad and snapping at the whole world and comes back a few</p>
      <p>weeks later with black-and-blue eyes like he’d been in a fist-fight, and he’s the sweetest, nicest, best-</p>
      <p>behaved thing you ever saw. He’ll maybe even go home in a month or two, a hat pulled low over the</p>
      <p>face of a sleepwalker wandering round in a simple, happy [21] dream. A success, they say, but I say</p>
      <p>he’s just another robot for the Combine and might be better off as a failure, like Ruckly sitting there</p>
      <p>fumbling and drooling over his picture. He never does much else. The dwarf black boy gets a rise</p>
      <p>out of him from time to time by leaning close and asking, “Say, Ruckly, what you figure your little</p>
      <p>wife  is  doing  in  town  tonight?”  Ruckly’s  head  comes  up.  Memory  whispers  someplace  in  that</p>
      <p>jumbled machinery. He turns red and his veins clog up at one end. This puffs him up so he can just</p>
      <p>barely make a little whistling sound in his throat. Bubbles squeeze out the corner of his mouth, he’s</p>
      <p>working  his  jaw  so  hard  to  say  something.  When he  finally  does  get  to  where he  can  say  his  few</p>
      <p>words it’s a low, choking noise to make your skin crawl—“Fffffffuck da wife! Fffffffuck da wife!” and</p>
      <p>passes out on the spot from the effort.</p>
      <p>Ellis  and  Ruckly  are  the  youngest  Chronics.  Colonel  Matterson  is  the  oldest,  an  old,  petrified</p>
      <p>cavalry soldier from the First War who is given to lifting the skirts of passing nurses with his cane,</p>
      <p>or teaching some kind of history out of the text of his left hand to anybody that’ll listen. He’s the</p>
      <p>oldest on the ward, but not the one’s been here longest—his wife brought him in only a few years</p>
      <p>back, when she got to where she wasn’t up to tending him any longer.</p>
      <p>I’m the one been here on the ward the longest, since the Second World War. I been here on the</p>
      <p>ward longer’n anybody. Longer’n any of the other patients. The Big Nurse has been here longer’n</p>
      <p>me.</p>
      <p>The Chronics and the Acutes don’t generally mingle. Each stays on his own side of the day room</p>
      <p>the  way  the  black  boys  want  it.  The  black  boys  say  it’s  more  orderly  that  way  and  let  everybody</p>
      <p>know that’s the way they’d like it to stay. They move us in after breakfast and look at the grouping</p>
      <p>and nod. “That’s right, gennulmen, that’s the way. Now you keep it that way.”</p>
      <p>Actually there isn’t much need for them to say anything, because, other than me, the Chronics</p>
      <p>don’t move around much, and the Acutes say they’d just as leave stay over on their own side, give</p>
      <p>reasons like the Chronic side smells worse than a dirty diaper. But I know it isn’t the stink that keeps</p>
      <p>them away from the Chronic side so much as they don’t like to be reminded that here’s what could</p>
      <p>happen to them someday. The Big Nurse recognizes this fear and knows how to put it to use; she’ll</p>
      <p>point out to an Acute, whenever he goes into a sulk, that you boys be good boys and cooperate with</p>
      <p>the staff policy which is engineered for your cure, or you’ll end up over on that side.</p>
      <p>[22]  (Everybody  on  the  ward  is  proud  of  the  way  the  patients  cooperate.  We  got  a  little  brass</p>
      <p>tablet tacked to a piece of maple wood that has printed on it: CONGRATULATIONS FOR GETTING</p>
      <p>ALONG  WITH  THE  SMALLEST  NUMBER  OF  PERSONNEL  OF  ANY  WARD  IN  THE  HOSPITAL.  It’s  a</p>
      <p>prize  for  cooperation.  It’s  hung  on  the  wall  right  above  the  log  book,  right  square  in  the  middle</p>
      <p>between the Chronics and Acutes.)</p>
      <p>This  new  redheaded  Admission,  McMurphy,  knows  right  away  he’s  not  a  Chronic.  After  he</p>
      <p>checks  the  day  room  over  a  minute,  he  sees  he’s  meant  for  the  Acute  side  and  goes  right  for  it,</p>
      <p>grinning and shaking hands with everybody he comes to. At first I see that he’s making everybody</p>
      <p>over there feel uneasy, with all his kidding and joking and with the brassy way he hollers at that black</p>
      <p>boy who’s still  after him with a thermometer, and especially with that big wide-open laugh of his.</p>
      <p>Dials twitch in the control panel at the sound of it. The Acutes look spooked and uneasy when he</p>
      <p>laughs,  the  way  kids  look  in  a  schoolroom  when  one  ornery  kid  is  raising  too  much hell  with the</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>14</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>teacher  out of  the  room  and they’re  all  scared  the teacher  might pop back  in  and  take  it  into her</p>
      <p>head  to  make  them  all  stay  after.  They’re  fidgeting  and  twitching,  responding  to  the  dials  in  the</p>
      <p>control panel; I see McMurphy notices he’s making them uneasy, but he don’t let it slow him down.</p>
      <p>“Damn,  what  a  sorry-looking  outfit.  You  boys  don’t  look  so  crazy  to  me.”  He’s  trying  to  get</p>
      <p>them to loosen up, the way you see an auctioneer spinning jokes to loosen up the crowd before the</p>
      <p>bidding starts. “Which one of you claims to be the craziest? Which one is the biggest loony? Who</p>
      <p>runs these card games? It’s my first day, and what I like to do is make a good impression straight off</p>
      <p>on the right man if he can prove to me he is the right man. Who’s the bull goose loony here?”</p>
      <p>He’s saying this directly to Billy Bibbit. He leans down and glares so hard at Billy that Billy feels</p>
      <p>compelled to stutter out that he isn’t the buh-buh-buh-bull goose loony yet, though he’s next in luh-</p>
      <p>luh-line for the job.</p>
      <p>McMurphy sticks a big hand down in front of Billy, and Billy can’t do a thing but shake it. “Well,</p>
      <p>buddy,” he says to Billy,  “I’m truly glad you’re next in luh-line for the job, but since I’m thinking</p>
      <p>about taking over this whole show myself, lock, stock, and barrel, maybe I better talk with the top</p>
      <p>man.” He looks round to where some of the Acutes have stopped their card-playing, covers one of</p>
      <p>his hands with the other, and cracks all his knuckles at the sight. “I figure, you see, buddy, to be sort</p>
      <p>of the gambling baron on this ward, deal a wicked game of [23] blackjack. So you better take me to</p>
      <p>your leader and we’ll get it straightened out who’s gonna be boss around here.”</p>
      <p>Nobody’s sure if this barrel-chested man with the, scar and the wild grin is play-acting or if he’s</p>
      <p>crazy enough to be just like he talks, or both, but they are all beginning to get a big kick out of going</p>
      <p>along with him. They watch as he puts that big red hand on Billy’s thin arm, waiting to see what Billy</p>
      <p>will say. Billy sees how it’s up to him to break the silence, so he looks around and picks out one of</p>
      <p>the pinochle-players: “Handing,” Billy says, “I guess it would b-b-be you. You’re p-president of Pay-</p>
      <p>Pay-Patient’s Council. This m-man wants to talk to you.”</p>
      <p>The  Acutes  are  grinning  now,  not  so  uneasy  any  more,  and  glad  that  something  out  of  the</p>
      <p>ordinary’s going on. They all razz Harding, ask him if he’s bull goose loony. He lays down his cards.</p>
      <p>Harding is a flat, nervous man with a face that sometimes makes you think you seen him in the</p>
      <p>movies, like it’s a face too pretty to just be a guy on the street. He’s got wide, thin shoulders and he</p>
      <p>curves them in around his chest when he’s trying to hide inside himself. He’s got hands so long and</p>
      <p>white and dainty I think they carved each other out of soap, and sometimes they get loose and glide</p>
      <p>around  in  front of  him  free  as two  white  birds  until  he  notices  them  and traps them  between  his</p>
      <p>knees; it bothers him that he’s got pretty hands.</p>
      <p>He’s president of the Patient’s Council on account of he has a paper that says he graduated from</p>
      <p>college. The paper’s framed and sits on his nightstand next to a picture of a woman in a bathing suit</p>
      <p>who  also  looks  like  you’ve  seen  her  in  the  moving  pictures—she’s  got  very  big  breasts  and  she’s</p>
      <p>holding  the  top  of  the  bathing  suit  up  over  them  with  her  fingers  and  looking  sideways  at  the</p>
      <p>camera. You can see Harding sitting on a towel behind her, looking skinny in his bathing suit, like</p>
      <p>he’s waiting for some big guy to kick sand on him. Harding brags a lot about having such a woman</p>
      <p>for a wife, says she’s the sexiest woman in the world and she can’t get enough of him nights.</p>
      <p>When Billy points him out Harding leans back in his chair and assumes an important look, speaks</p>
      <p>up  at  the  ceiling  without  looking  at  Billy  or  McMurphy.  “Does  this  ...  gentleman  have  an</p>
      <p>appointment, Mr. Bibbit?”</p>
      <p>“Do you have an appointment, Mr. McM-m-murphy? Mr. Harding is a busy man, nobody sees</p>
      <p>him without an ap-appointment.”</p>
      <p>“This busy man Mr. Harding, is he the bull goose loony?” [24] He looks at Billy with one eye, and</p>
      <p>Billy nods his head up and down real fast; Billy’s tickled with all the attention he’s getting.</p>
      <p>“Then you tell Bull Goose Loony Harding that R. P. McMurphy is waiting to see him and that</p>
      <p>this  hospital  ain’t  big  enough  for  the  two  of  us.  I’m  accustomed  to  being  top  man. I  been  a  bull</p>

      <p>15</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>goose catskinner for every gyppo logging operation in the Northwest and bull goose gambler all the</p>
      <p>way from Korea, was even bull goose pea weeder on that pea farm at Pendleton—so I figure if I’m</p>
      <p>bound to be a loony, then I’m bound to be a stompdown dadgum good one. Tell this Harding that</p>
      <p>he either meets me man to man or he’s a yaller skunk and better be outta town by sunset.”</p>
      <p>Harding  leans  farther back,  hooks  his  thumbs  in his  lapels.  “Bibbit,  you tell  this  young  upstart</p>
      <p>McMurphy that I’ll meet him in the main hall at high noon and we’ll settle this affair once and for</p>
      <p>all, libidos a-blazin’.” Harding tries to drawl like McMurphy; it sounds funny with his high, breathy</p>
      <p>voice. “You might also warn him, just to be fair, that I have been bull goose loony on this ward for</p>
      <p>nigh onto two years, and that I’m crazier than any man alive.”</p>
      <p>“Mr.  Bibbit,  you  might  warn  this  Mr.  Harding  that  I’m  so  crazy  I  admit  to  voting  for</p>
      <p>Eisenhower.”</p>
      <p>“Bibbit! You tell Mr. McMurphy I’m so crazy I voted for Eisenhower twice!”</p>
      <p>“And  you  tell  Mr.  Harding  right  back”—he  puts  both hands  on  the  table  and  leans  down,  his</p>
      <p>voice getting low—“that I’m so crazy I plan to vote for Eisenhower again this November.”</p>
      <p>“I take off my hat,” Harding says, bows his head, and shakes hands with McMurphy. There’s no</p>
      <p>doubt in my mind that McMurphy’s won, but I’m not sure just what.</p>
      <p>All the other Acutes leave what they’ve been doing and ease up close to see what new sort this</p>
      <p>fellow is. Nobody like him’s ever been on the ward before. They’re asking him where he’s from and</p>
      <p>what his business is in a way I’ve never seen them do before. He says he’s a dedicated man. He says</p>
      <p>he was just a wanderer and logging bum before the Army took him and taught him what his natural</p>
      <p>bent  was;  just  like  they  taught  some  men  to  goldbrick  and  some  men  to  goof  off,  he  says,  they</p>
      <p>taught him to play poker. Since then he’s settled down and devoted himself to gambling on all levels.</p>
      <p>Just play poker and stay single and live where and how he wants to, if people would let him, he says,</p>
      <p>“but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man. Ever since I found my callin’ I done time in</p>
      <p>so many small-town jails I could write a brochure. They say I’m [25] a habitual hassler. Like I fight</p>
      <p>some.  Sheeut.  They  didn’t  mind  so  much  when I was  a  dumb  logger  and  got  into  a hassle;  that’s</p>
      <p>excusable, they say, that’s a hard-workin’ feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you’re a gambler, if</p>
      <p>they know you to get up a back-room game now and then, all you have to do is spit slantwise and</p>
      <p>you’re  a  goddamned  criminal.  Hooee,  it  was  breaking  up  the  budget  drivin’  me  to  and  from  the</p>
      <p>pokey for a while there.”</p>
      <p>He shakes his head and puffs out his cheeks.</p>
      <p>“But  that  was  just  for  a  period  of  time.  I  learned  the  ropes.  To  tell  the  truth,  this  ‘sault  and</p>
      <p>battery I was doing in Pendleton was the first hitch in close to a year. That’s why I got busted. I was</p>
      <p>outa practice; this guy was able to get up off the floor and get to the cops before I left town. A very</p>
      <p>tough individual …”</p>
      <p>He laughs again and shakes hands and sits down to arm wrestle every time that black boy gets</p>
      <p>too near him with the thermometer, till he’s met everybody on the Acute side. And when he finishes</p>
      <p>shaking  hands  with  the  last  Acute  he  comes  right  on  over  to  the  Chronics,  like  we  aren’t  no</p>
      <p>different. You can’t tell if he’s really this friendly or if he’s got some gambler’s reason for trying to</p>
      <p>get acquainted with guys so far gone a lot of them don’t even know their names.</p>
      <p>He’s there pulling Ellis’s hand off the wall and shaking it just like he was a politician running for</p>
      <p>something and Ellis’s vote was good as anybody’s. “Buddy,” he says to Ellis in a solemn voice, “my</p>
      <p>name is R. P. McMurphy and I don’t like to see a full-grown man sloshin’ around in his own water.</p>
      <p>Whyn’t you go get dried up?”</p>
      <p>Ellis looks down at the puddle around his feet in pure surprise. “Why, I thank you,” he says and</p>
      <p>even moves off a few steps toward the latrine before the nails pull his hands back to the wall.</p>
      <p>McMurphy  comes  down  the  line  of  Chronics,  shakes  hands  with  Colonel  Matterson  and  with</p>
      <p>Ruckly  and  with  Old  Pete.  He  shakes  the  hands of  Wheelers  and  Walkers  and  Vegetables,  shakes</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>16</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>hands that he has to pick up out of laps like picking up dead birds, mechanical birds, wonders of tiny</p>
      <p>bones and wires that have run down and fallen. Shakes hands with everybody he comes to except</p>
      <p>Big George the water freak, who grins and shies back from that unsanitary hand, so McMurphy just</p>
      <p>salutes him and says to his own right hand as he walks away, “Hand, how do you suppose that old</p>
      <p>fellow knew all the evil you been into?”</p>
      <p>Nobody  can  make  out  what he’s  driving  at,  or  why  he’s  [26]  making  such  a  fuss  with  meeting</p>
      <p>everybody,  but  it’s  better’n  mixing  jigsaw  puzzles.  He  keeps  saying  it’s  a  necessary  thing  to  get</p>
      <p>around and meet the men he’ll be dealing with, part of a gambler’s job. But he must know he ain’t</p>
      <p>going to be dealing with no eighty-year-old organic who couldn’t do any more with a playing card</p>
      <p>than put it in his mouth and gum it awhile. Yet he looks like he’s enjoying himself, like he’s the sort</p>
      <p>of guy that gets a laugh out of people.</p>
      <p>I’m the last one. Still strapped in the chair in the corner. McMurphy stops when he gets to me</p>
      <p>and hooks his thumbs in his pockets again and leans back to laugh, like he sees something funnier</p>
      <p>about me than about anybody else. All of a sudden I was scared he was laughing because he knew</p>
      <p>the  way  I  was  sitting  there  with  my  knees  pulled  up  and  my  arms  wrapped  around  them,  staring</p>
      <p>straight ahead as though I couldn’t hear a thing, was all an act.</p>
      <p>“Hooeee,” he said, “look what we got here.”</p>
      <p>I  remember  all  this part real  clear.  I remember  the  way  he  closed  one  eye  and tipped  his  head</p>
      <p>back and looked down across that healing wine-colored scar on his nose, laughing at me. I thought</p>
      <p>at first that he was laughing because of how funny it looked, an Indian’s face and black, oily Indian’s</p>
      <p>hair on somebody like me. I thought maybe he was laughing at how weak I looked. But then’s when</p>
      <p>I remember thinking that he was laughing because he wasn’t fooled for one minute by my deaf-and-</p>
      <p>dumb act; it didn’t make any difference how cagey the act was, he was onto me and was laughing and</p>
      <p>winking to let me know it.</p>
      <p>“What’s your story, Big Chief? You look like Sittin’ Bull on a sitdown strike.” He looked over to</p>
      <p>the Acutes to see if they might laugh about his joke; when they just sniggered he looked back to me</p>
      <p>and winked again. “What’s your name, Chief?”</p>
      <p>Billy Bibbit called across the room. “His n-n-name is Bromden. Chief Bromden. Everybody calls</p>
      <p>him  Chief  Buh-Broom,  though,  because  the  aides  have  him  sweeping  a  l-large  part  of  the  time.</p>
      <p>There’s not m-much else he can do, I guess. He’s deaf.” Billy put his chin in hands. “If I was d-d-</p>
      <p>deaf”—he sighed—“I would kill myself.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy  kept  looking  at  me.  “He  gets  his  growth,  he’ll  be  pretty  good-sized,  won’t  he?  I</p>
      <p>wonder how tall he is.”</p>
      <p>“I think somebody m-m-measured him once at s-six feet seven; but even if he is big, he’s scared</p>
      <p>of his own sh-sh-shadow. Just a bi-big deaf Indian.”</p>
      <p>“When I saw him sittin’ here I thought he looked some Indian. But Bromden ain’t an Indian name.</p>
      <p>What tribe is he?”</p>
      <p>[27] “I don’t know,” Billy said. “He was here wh-when I c-came.”</p>
      <p>“I  have  information  from  the  doctor,”  Harding  said,  “that  he  is  only  half  Indian,  a  Columbia</p>
      <p>Indian, I believe. That’s a defunct Columbia Gorge tribe. The doctor said his father was the tribal</p>
      <p>leader,  hence  this  fellow’s  title,  ‘Chief.’  As  to  the  ‘Bromden’  part  of  the  name,  I’m  afraid  my</p>
      <p>knowledge in Indian lore doesn’t cover that.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy leaned his head down near mine where I had to look at him. “Is that right? You deef,</p>
      <p>Chief?”</p>
      <p>“He’s de-de-deef and dumb.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy puckered his lips and looked at my face a long time. Then he straightened back up</p>
      <p>and  stuck  his  hand  out.  “Well,  what  the  hell,  he  can  shake  hands  can’t  he?  Deef  or  whatever.  By</p>

      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>God, Chief, you may be big, but you shake my hand or I’ll consider it an insult. And it’s not a good</p>
      <p>idea to insult the new bull goose loony of the hospital.”</p>
      <p>When he  said  that  he  looked back  over  to  Harding  and  Billy  and  made  a  face, but he  left  that</p>
      <p>hand in front of me, big as a dinner plate.</p>
      <p>I  remember  real  clear  the  way  that hand  looked: there  was  carbon  under  the  fingernails  where</p>
      <p>he’d  worked  once  in  a  garage;  there  was  an  anchor  tattooed  back  from  the  knuckles;  there  was  a</p>
      <p>dirty  Band-Aid  on  the  middle  knuckle,  peeling  up  at  the  edge.  All  the  rest  of  the  knuckles  were</p>
      <p>covered with scars and cuts, old and new. I remember the palm was smooth and hard as bone from</p>
      <p>hefting the wooden handles of axes and hoes, not the hand you’d think could deal cards. The palm</p>
      <p>was callused, and the calluses were cracked, and dirt was worked in the cracks. A road map of his</p>
      <p>travels up and down the West. That palm made a scuffing sound against my hand. I remember the</p>
      <p>fingers were thick and strong closing over mine, and my hand commenced to feel peculiar and went</p>
      <p>to swelling up out there on my stick of an arm, like he was transmitting his own blood into it. It rang</p>
      <p>with blood and power: It blowed up near as big as his, I remember. ...</p>
      <p>“Mr. McMurry.”</p>
      <p>It’s the Big Nurse.</p>
      <p>“Mr. McMurry, could you come here please?”</p>
      <p>It’s the Big Nurse. That black boy with the thermometer has gone and got her. She stands there</p>
      <p>tapping  that  thermometer  against  her  wrist  watch, eyes  whirring  while  she  tries  to  gauge  this  new</p>
      <p>man. Her lips are in that triangle shape, like a doll’s lips ready for a fake nipple.</p>
      <p>“Aide Williams tells me, Mr. McMurry, that you’ve been somewhat difficult about your admission</p>
      <p>shower. Is this true? [28] Please understand, I appreciate the way you’ve taken it upon yourself to</p>
      <p>orient with the other patients on the ward, but everything in its own good time, Mr. McMurry. I’m</p>
      <p>sorry to interrupt you and Mr. Bromden, but you do understand: everyone ... must follow the rules.”</p>
      <p>He tips his head back and gives that wink that she isn’t fooling him any more than I did, that he’s</p>
      <p>onto her. He looks up at her with one eye for a minute.</p>
      <p>“Ya know, ma’am,” he says, “ya know—that is the ex-act thing somebody always tells me about</p>
      <p>the rules ...”</p>
      <p>He grins. They both smile back and forth at each other, sizing each other up.</p>
      <p>“… just when they figure I’m about to do the dead opposite.”</p>
      <p>Then he lets go my hand.</p>

      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>4</p>
      <p>In the glass Station the Big Nurse has opened a package from a foreign address and is sucking</p>
      <p>into hypodermic needles the grass-and-milk liquid that came in vial in the package. One of the little</p>
      <p>nurses, a girl with one wandering eye that always keeps looking worried over her shoulder while the</p>
      <p>other  one  goes  about  its  usual  business,  picks  up  the  little  tray  of  filled  needles  but  doesn’t  carry</p>
      <p>them away just yet.</p>
      <p>“What,  Miss  Ratched,  is  your  opinion of  this  new patient?  I mean,  gee,  he’s  good-looking  and</p>
      <p>friendly and everything, but in my humble opinion he certainly takes over.”</p>
      <p>The Big Nurse tests a needle against her fingertip. “I’m afraid”—she stabs the needle down in the</p>
      <p>rubber-capped vial and lifts the plunger—“that is exactly what the new patient is planning: to take</p>
      <p>over. He is what we call a ‘manipulator,’ Miss Flinn, a man who will use everyone and everything to</p>
      <p>his own ends.”</p>
      <p>“Oh. But. I mean, in a mental hospital? What could his ends be?”</p>
      <p>“Any number of things.” She’s calm, smiling, lost in the work of loading the needles. “Comfort</p>
      <p>and an easy life, for instance; the feeling of power and respect, perhaps; monetary gain—perhaps all</p>
      <p>of these things. Sometimes a manipulator’s own ends are simply the actual disruption of the ward for</p>
      <p>the sake of disruption. There are such people in our society. A manipulator can influence the other</p>
      <p>patients  and  disrupt  them  to  such  an  extent  that  it  may  take  months  to  get  everything  running</p>
      <p>smooth once more. With the present permissive philosophy in mental hospitals, it’s easy for them to</p>
      <p>get away with it. Some years back it was quite different. I recall some years back we had a man, a Mr.</p>
      <p>Taber, on the ward, and he was an intolerable Ward Manipulator. For a while.” She looks up from her</p>
      <p>work, needle half filled in front of her face like a little wand. Her eyes get far-off and pleased with</p>
      <p>the memory. “Mistur Tay-bur,” she says.</p>
      <p>“But, gee,” the other nurse says, “what on earth would make  a man want to do something like</p>
      <p>disrupt the ward for, Miss Ratched? What possible motive …?”</p>
      <p>[30] She cuts the little nurse off by jabbing the needle back into the vial’s rubber top, fills it, jerks</p>
      <p>it out, and lays it on the tray. I watch her hand reach for another empty needle, watch it dart out,</p>
      <p>hinge over it, drop.</p>
      <p>“You seem to forget, Miss Flinn, that this is an institution for the insane.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>The Big Nurse tends to get real put out if something keeps her outfit from running like a smooth,</p>
      <p>accurate, precision-made machine. The slightest thing messy or out of kilter or in the way ties her</p>
      <p>into  a  little  white  knot  of  tight-smiled  fury.  She  walks  around  with  that  same  doll  smile  crimped</p>
      <p>between her chin and her nose and that same calm whir coming from her eyes, but down inside of</p>
      <p>her  she’s  tense  as  steel.  I  know,  I can  feel  it.  And she  don’t  relax  a  hair  till  she  gets  the  nuisance</p>
      <p>attended to—what she calls “adjusted to surroundings.”</p>
      <p>Under her rule the ward Inside is  almost completely adjusted to surroundings. But the thing is</p>
      <p>she can’t be on the ward all the time. She’s got to spend some time Outside. So she works with an</p>
      <p>eye to adjusting the Outside world too. Working alongside others like her who I call the “Combine,”</p>
      <p>which is a huge organization that aims to adjust the Outside as well as she has the Inside, has made</p>
      <p>her a real veteran at adjusting things. She was already the Big Nurse in the old place when I came in</p>
      <p>from the Outside so long back, and she’d been dedicating herself to adjustment for God knows how</p>
      <p>long.</p>
      <p>And  I’ve  watched  her  get  more  and  more  skillful  over  the  years.  Practice  has  steadied  and</p>
      <p>strengthened her until now she wields a sure power that extends in all directions on hairlike wires</p>
      <p>too small for anybody’s eye but mine; I see her sit in the center of this web of wires like a watchful</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>19</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>robot, tend her network with mechanical insect skill, know every second which wire runs where and</p>
      <p>just what current to send up to get the results she wants. I was an electrician’s assistant in training</p>
      <p>camp before the Army shipped me to Germany and I had some electronics in my year in college is</p>
      <p>how I learned about the way these things can be rigged.</p>
      <p>What  she  dreams  of  there  in  the  center  of  those  wires  is  a  world  of  precision  efficiency  and</p>
      <p>tidiness like a pocket watch with a glass back, a place where the schedule is unbreakable and all the</p>
      <p>patients who aren’t Outside, obedient under her beam, are wheelchair Chronics with catheter tubes</p>
      <p>run direct from every pantleg to the sewer under the floor. Year by year [31] she accumulates her</p>
      <p>ideal staff: doctors, all ages and types, come and rise up in front of her with ideas of their own about</p>
      <p>the way a ward should be run, some with backbone enough to stand behind their ideas, and she fixes</p>
      <p>these doctors with dry-ice eyes day in, day out, until they retreat with unnatural chills. “I tell you I</p>
      <p>don’t know what it is,” they tell the guy in charge of personnel. “Since I started on that ward with</p>
      <p>that woman I feel like my veins are running ammonia. I shiver all the time, my kids won’t sit in my</p>
      <p>lap, my wife won’t sleep with me. I insist on a transfer—neurology bin, the alky tank, pediatrics, I</p>
      <p>just don’t care!”</p>
      <p>She keeps this up for years. The doctors last three weeks, three months. Until she finally settles</p>
      <p>for a little man with a big wide forehead and wide jewly cheeks and squeezed narrow across his tiny</p>
      <p>eyes like he once wore glasses that were way too small, wore them for so long they crimped his face</p>
      <p>in the middle, so now he has glasses on a string to his collar button; they teeter on the purple bridge</p>
      <p>of his little nose and they are always slipping one side or the other so he’ll tip his head when he talks</p>
      <p>just to keep his glasses level. That’s her doctor.</p>
      <p>Her  three  daytime  black  boys  she  acquires  after  more  years of  testing  and  rejecting  thousands.</p>
      <p>They  come  at  her  in  a  long  black  row  of  sulky,  big-nosed  masks,  hating  her  and  her  chalk  doll</p>
      <p>whiteness from the first look they get. She appraises them and their hate for a month or so, then lets</p>
      <p>them go because they don’t hate enough. When she finally gets the three she wants—gets them one</p>
      <p>at a time over a number of years, weaving them into her plan and her network—she’s damn positive</p>
      <p>they hate enough to be capable.</p>
      <p>The first one she gets five years after I been on the ward, a twisted sinewy dwarf the color of cold</p>
      <p>asphalt. His mother was raped in Georgia while his papa stood by tied to the hot iron stove with</p>
      <p>plow  traces,  blood  streaming  into  his  shoes.  The  boy  watched  from  a  closet,  five  years  old  and</p>
      <p>squinting his eye to peep out the crack between the door and the jamb, and he never grew an inch</p>
      <p>after. Now his eyelids hang loose and thin from his brow like he’s got a bat perched on the bridge of</p>
      <p>his nose. Eyelids like thin gray leather, he lifts them up just a bit whenever a new white man comes</p>
      <p>on the ward, peeks out from under them and studies the man up and down and nods just once like</p>
      <p>he’s oh yes made positive certain of something he was already sure of. He wanted to carry a sock full</p>
      <p>of birdshot when he first came on the job, to work the patients into shape, but she told him they</p>
      <p>didn’t  do  it  that  way  [32]  anymore,  made  him  leave  the  sap  at  home  and  taught  him  her  own</p>
      <p>technique; taught him not to show his hate and to be calm and wait,  wait  for a little advantage, a</p>
      <p>little  slack,  then  twist  the rope  and  keep the pressure  steady.  All  the  time.  That’s  the  way  you  get</p>
      <p>them into shape, she taught him.</p>
      <p>The other two black boys come two years later, coming to work only about a month apart and</p>
      <p>both looking so much alike I think she had a replica made of the one who came first. They are tall</p>
      <p>and  sharp  and  bony  and  their  faces  are  chipped  into  expressions  that  never  change,  like  flint</p>
      <p>arrowheads. Their eyes come to points. If you brush against their hair it rasps the hide right off you.</p>
      <p>All of them black as telephones. The blacker they are, she learned from that long dark row that</p>
      <p>came before them, the more time they are likely to devote to cleaning and scrubbing and keeping the</p>
      <p>ward in order. For instance, all three of these boys’ uniforms are always spotless as snow. White and</p>
      <p>cold and stiff as her own.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>20</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>All three wear starched snow-white pants and white shirts with metal snaps down one side and</p>
      <p>white shoes polished like ice, and the shoes have red rubber soles silent as mice up and down the</p>
      <p>hall.  They  never  make  any  noise  when they  move. They materialize  in  different parts of  the  ward</p>
      <p>every  time  a  patient  figures  to  check  himself  in  private  or  whisper  some  secret to  another  guy.  A</p>
      <p>patient’ll be in a corner all by himself, when all of a sudden there’s a squeak and frost forms along</p>
      <p>his cheek, and he turns in that direction and there’s a cold stone mask floating above him against the</p>
      <p>wall. He just sees the black face. No body. The walls are white as the white suits, polished clean as a</p>
      <p>refrigerator door, and the black face and hands seem to float against it like a ghost.</p>
      <p>Years  of  training,  and  all  three  black  boys  tune  in  closer  and  closer  with  the  Big  Nurse’s</p>
      <p>frequency. One by one they are able to disconnect the direct wires and operate on beams. She never</p>
      <p>gives  orders  out  loud  or  leaves  written  instructions  that  might  be  found  by  a  visiting  wife  or</p>
      <p>schoolteacher. Doesn’t need to any more. They are in contact on a high-voltage wave length of hate,</p>
      <p>and the black boys are out there performing her bidding before she even thinks it.</p>
      <p>So after the nurse gets her staff, efficiency locks the ward like a watchman’s clock. Everything the</p>
      <p>guys think and say and do is all worked out months in advance, based on the little notes the nurse</p>
      <p>makes during the day. This is typed and fed into the machine I hear humming behind the steel door</p>
      <p>in the rear of the Nurses’ Station. A number of Order Daily [33] Cards are returned, punched with a</p>
      <p>pattern of little square holes. At the beginning of each day the properly dated OD card is inserted in</p>
      <p>a slot in the steel door and the walls hum up: Lights flash on in the dorm at six-thirty: the Acutes up</p>
      <p>out of bed quick as the black boys can prod them out, get them to work buffing the floor, emptying</p>
      <p>ash trays, polishing the scratch marks off the wall where one old fellow shorted out a day ago, went</p>
      <p>down in an awful twist of smoke and smell of burned rubber. The Wheelers swing dead log legs out</p>
      <p>on the floor and wait like seated statues for somebody to roll chairs in to them. The Vegetables piss</p>
      <p>the bed, activating an electric shock and buzzer, rolls them off on the tile where the black boys can</p>
      <p>hose them down and get them in clean greens. …</p>
      <p>Six-forty-five the shavers buzz and the Acutes line up in alphabetical order at the mirrors, A, B, C,</p>
      <p>D.  ...  The  walking  Chronics  like  me  walk  in  when  the  Acutes  are  done,  then  the  Wheelers  are</p>
      <p>wheeled in. The three old guys left, a film of yellow mold on the loose hide under their chins, they</p>
      <p>get shaved in their lounge chairs in the day room, a leather strap across the forehead to keep them</p>
      <p>from flopping around under the shaver.</p>
      <p>Some  mornings—Mondays  especially—I  hide  and  try  to  buck  the  schedule.  Other  mornings  I</p>
      <p>figure it’s cagier to step right into place between A and C in the alphabet and move the route like</p>
      <p>everybody else, without lifting my feet—powerful magnets in the floor maneuver personnel through</p>
      <p>the ward like arcade puppets. ...</p>
      <p>Seven o’clock the mess hall opens and the order of line-up reverses: the Wheelers first, then the</p>
      <p>Walkers,  then  the  Acutes  pick  up  trays,  corn  flakes,  bacon  and  eggs,  toast—and  this  morning  a</p>
      <p>canned  peach  on  a  piece  of  green,  torn  lettuce.  Some  of  the  Acutes  bring  trays  to  the  Wheelers.</p>
      <p>Most Wheelers are just Chronics with bad legs, they feed themselves, but there’s these three of them</p>
      <p>got  no  action  from  the  neck  down  whatsoever,  not  much  from  the  neck  up.  These  are  called</p>
      <p>Vegetables. The black boys push them in after everybody else is sat down, wheel them against a wall,</p>
      <p>and  bring  them  identical  trays  of  muddy-looking  food  with  little  white  diet  cards  attached  to  the</p>
      <p>trays.  Mechanical  Soft,  reads  the  diet  cards  for  these  toothless  three:  eggs,  ham,  toast,  bacon,  all</p>
      <p>chewed thirty-two times apiece by the stainless-steel machine in the kitchen. I see it purse sectioned</p>
      <p>lips,  like  a  vacuum-cleaner  hose,  and  spurt  a  clot  of  chewed-up  ham  onto  a plate  with  a  barnyard</p>
      <p>sound.</p>
      <p>[34]  The  black  boys  stoke  the  sucking  pink  mouths  of  the  Vegetables  a  shade  too  fast  for</p>
      <p>swallowing, and the Mechanical Soft squeezes out down their little knobs of chins onto the greens.</p>
      <p>The  black  boys  cuss  the  Vegetables  and  ream  the  mouths  bigger  with  a  twisting  motion  of  the</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>21</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>spoon, like coring a rotten apple: “This ol’ fart Blastic, he’s comin’ to pieces befo’ my very eyes. I</p>
      <p>can’t tell no more if I’m feeding him bacon puree or chunks of his own fuckin’ tongue.” …</p>
      <p>Seven-thirty  back  to  the  day  room.  The  Big  Nurse  looks  out  through  her  special  glass,  always</p>
      <p>polished till you can’t tell it’s there, and nods at what she sees, reaches up and tears a sheet off her</p>
      <p>calendar one day closer to the goal. She pushes a button for things to start. I hear the wharrup of a</p>
      <p>big sheet of tin being shook someplace. Everybody come to order. Acutes: sit on your side of the</p>
      <p>day room and wait for cards and Monopoly games to be brought out. Chronics: sit on your side and</p>
      <p>wait for puzzles from the Red Cross box. Ellis: go to your place at the wall, hands up to receive the</p>
      <p>nails and pee running down your leg. Pete: wag your head like a puppet. Scanlon: work your knobby</p>
      <p>hands  on  the table  in  front of  you,  constructing  a make-believe  bomb to  blow  up  a make-believe</p>
      <p>world. Harding: begin talking, waving your dove hands in the air, then trap them under your armpits</p>
      <p>because  grown  men  aren’t  supposed  to  wave  their  pretty  hands  that  way.  Sefelt:  begin  moaning</p>
      <p>about  your  teeth  hurting  and  your  hair  falling  out.  Everybody:  breath  in  ...  and  out  …  in  perfect</p>
      <p>order; hearts all beating at the rate the OD cards have ordered. Sound of matched cylinders.</p>
      <p>Like a cartoon world, where the figures are flat and outlined in black, jerking through some kind</p>
      <p>of goofy story that might be real funny if it weren’t for the cartoon figures being real guys ...</p>
      <p>Seven-forty-five the black boys move down the line of Chronics taping catheters on the ones that</p>
      <p>will hold still for it. Catheters are second-hand condoms the ends clipped off and rubber-banded to</p>
      <p>tubes that run down pantlegs to a plastic sack marked DISPOSABLE NOT TO BE RE-USED, which it is</p>
      <p>my job to wash out at the end of each day. The black boys anchor the condom by taping it to the</p>
      <p>hairs; old Catheter Chronics are hairless as babies from tape removal. …</p>
      <p>Eight  o’clock  the  walls  whirr  and  hum  into  full  swing.  The  speaker  in  the  ceiling  says,</p>
      <p>“Medications,”  using  the  Big  Nurse’s  voice.  We  look  in  the  glass  case  where  she  sits,  but  she’s</p>
      <p>nowhere near the microphone; in fact, she’s ten feet away from the microphone, tutoring one of the</p>
      <p>little nurses [35] how to prepare a neat drug tray with pills arranged orderly. The Acutes line up at</p>
      <p>the glass door, A, B, C, D, then the Chronics, then the Wheelers (the Vegetables get theirs later, mixed</p>
      <p>in a spoon of applesauce). The guys file by and get a capsule in a paper cup—throw it to the back of</p>
      <p>the throat and get the cup filled with water by the little nurse and wash the capsule down. On rare</p>
      <p>occasions some fool might ask what he’s being required to swallow.</p>
      <p>“Wait just a shake, honey; what are these two little red capsules in here with my vitamin?”</p>
      <p>I know him. He’s a big, griping Acute, already getting the reputation of being a troublemaker.</p>
      <p>“It’s just medication, Mr. Taber, good for you. Down it goes, now.”</p>
      <p>“But I mean what kind of medication. Christ, I can see that they’re pills—”</p>
      <p>“Just swallow it all, shall we, Mr. Taber—just for me?” She takes a quick look at the Big Nurse to</p>
      <p>see how the little flirting technique she is using  is  accepted, then looks back at the Acute. He still</p>
      <p>isn’t ready to swallow something he don’t know what is, not even just for her.</p>
      <p>“Miss, I don’t like to create trouble. But I don’t like to swallow something without knowing what</p>
      <p>it is, neither. How do I know this isn’t one of those funny pills that makes me something I’m not?”</p>
      <p>“Don’t get upset, Mr. Taber—”</p>
      <p>“Upset? All I want to know, for the lova Jesus—”</p>
      <p>But the Big Nurse has come up quietly, locked her hand on his arm, paralyzes him all the way to</p>
      <p>the  shoulder.  “That’s  all  right, Miss  Flinn,”  she  says.  “If  Mr.  Taber  chooses  to  act  like  a  child,  he</p>
      <p>may have to be treated as such. We’ve tried to be kind and considerate with him. Obviously, that’s</p>
      <p>not the answer. Hostility, hostility, that’s the thanks we get. You can go, Mr. Taber, if you don’t wish</p>
      <p>to take your medication orally.”</p>
      <p>“All I wanted to know, for the—”</p>
      <p>“You can go.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>22</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>He  goes  off,  grumbling,  when  she  frees  his  arm,  and  spends  the  morning  moping  around  the</p>
      <p>latrine,  wondering  about those  capsules.  I  got  away  once holding  one of  those  same  red  capsules</p>
      <p>under my tongue, played like I’d swallowed it, and crushed it open later in the broom closet. For a</p>
      <p>tick of time, before it all turned into white dust, I saw it was a miniature electronic element like the</p>
      <p>ones  I  helped  the  Radar  Corps  work  with  in  the  Army,  microscopic  wires  and  grids  and  [36]</p>
      <p>transistors, this one designed to dissolve on contact with air. …</p>
      <p>Eight-twenty the cards and puzzles go out. …</p>
      <p>Eight-twenty-five  some  Acute  mentions  he  used  to  watch  his  sister  taking  her  bath;  the  three</p>
      <p>guys at the table with him fall all over each other to see who gets to write it in the log book. …</p>
      <p>Eight-thirty  the  ward  door  opens  and  two  technicians  trot  in,  smelling  like  grape  wine;</p>
      <p>technicians always move at a fast walk or a trot because they’re always leaning so far forward they</p>
      <p>have  to  move  fast  to  keep  standing.  They  always  lean  forward  and  they  always  smell  like  they</p>
      <p>sterilized their instruments in wine. They pull the lab door to behind them, and I sweep up close and</p>
      <p>can snake out voices over the vicious zzzth-zzzth-zzzth of steel on whetstone.</p>
      <p>“What we got already at this ungodly hour of the morning?”</p>
      <p>“We got to install an Indwelling Curiosity Cutout in some nosy booger. Hurry-up job, she says,</p>
      <p>and I’m not even sure we got one of the gizmos in stock.”</p>
      <p>“We might have to call IBM to rush one out for us; let me check back in Supply—”</p>
      <p>“Hey; bring out a bottle of that pure grain while you’re back there: it’s getting so I can’t install the</p>
      <p>simplest frigging component but what I need a bracer. Well, what the hell, it’s better’n garage work.</p>
      <p>…”</p>
      <p>Their  voices  are  forced  and  too  quick  on  the  comeback  to  be  real  talk—more  like  cartoon</p>
      <p>comedy speech. I sweep away before I’m caught eavesdropping.</p>
      <p>The two big black boys catch Taber in the latrine and drag him. to the mattress room. He gets</p>
      <p>one a good kick in the shins. He’s yelling bloody murder. I’m surprised how helpless he looks when</p>
      <p>they hold him, like he was wrapped with bands of black iron.</p>
      <p>They  push  him  face  down  on the mattress.  One  sits  on  his  head,  and  the  other rips  his  pants</p>
      <p>open in back and peels the cloth until Taber’s peach-colored rear is framed by the ragged lettuce-</p>
      <p>green. He’s smothering curses into the mattress and the black boy sitting on his head saying, “Tha’s</p>
      <p>right,  Mistuh  Taber,  tha’s  right.  ...”  The  nurse  comes  down  the  hall,  smearing  Vaseline  on  a  long</p>
      <p>needle, pulls the door shut so they’re out of sight for a second, then comes right back out, wiping</p>
      <p>the needle on a shred of Taber’s pants. She’s left the Vaseline jar in the room. Before the black boy</p>
      <p>can close the door after her I see the one still sitting on Taber’s head, [37] dabbing at him with a</p>
      <p>Kleenex. They’re in there a long time before the door opens up again and they come out, carrying</p>
      <p>him across the hall to the lab. His greens are ripped clear off now and he’s wrapped up in a damp</p>
      <p>sheet. ...</p>
      <p>Nine o’clock young residents wearing leather elbows talk to Acutes for fifty minutes about what</p>
      <p>they  did  when  they  were  little  boys.  The  Big  Nurse  is  suspicious  of  the  crew-cut  looks  of  these</p>
      <p>residents, and that fifty minutes they are on the ward is a tough time for her. While they are around,</p>
      <p>the machinery goes to fumbling and she is scowling and making notes to check the records of these</p>
      <p>boys for old traffic violations and the like. …</p>
      <p>Nine-fifty the residents leave and the machinery hums up smooth again. The nurse watches the</p>
      <p>day room from her glass case; the scene before her takes on that blue-steel clarity again, that clean</p>
      <p>orderly movement of a cartoon comedy.</p>
      <p>Taber is wheeled out of the lab on a Gurney bed.</p>
      <p>“We  had  to  give  him  another  shot  when  he  started  coming  up  during  the  spine  tap,”  the</p>
      <p>technician tells her. “What do you say we take him right on over to Building One and buzz him with</p>
      <p>EST while we’re at it—that way not waste the extra Seconal?”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>23</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“I think it is an excellent suggestion. Maybe after that take him to the electroencephalograph and</p>
      <p>check his head—we may find evidence of a need for brain work.”</p>
      <p>The  technicians  go  trotting  off,  pushing  the  man  on  the  Gurney,  like  cartoon  men—or  like</p>
      <p>puppets, mechanical puppets in one of those Punch and Judy acts where it’s supposed to be funny</p>
      <p>to see the puppet beat up by the Devil and swallowed headfirst by a smiling alligator. ...</p>
      <p>Ten o’clock the mail comes up. Sometimes you get the torn envelope. ...</p>
      <p>Ten-thirty Public Relation comes in with a ladies’ club following him. He claps his fat hands at</p>
      <p>the day-room door. “Oh, hello guys; stiff lip, stiff lip ... look around, girls; isn’t it clean, so bright?</p>
      <p>This is Miss Ratched. I chose this ward because it’s her ward. She’s, girls, just like a mother. Not that</p>
      <p>I mean age, but you girls understand ...”</p>
      <p>Public  Relation’s  shirt  collar  is  so  tight  it  bloats his  face  up  when he  laughs,  and  he’s  laughing</p>
      <p>most of the time I don’t ever know what at, laughing high and fast like he wishes he could stop but</p>
      <p>can’t do it. And his face bloated up red and round as a balloon with a face painted on it. He got no</p>
      <p>hair on his face and none on his head to speak of; it looks like he [38] glued some on once but it</p>
      <p>kept slipping off and getting in his cuffs and his shirt pocket and down his collar. Maybe that’s why</p>
      <p>he keeps his collar so tight, to keep the little pieces of hair from falling down in there.</p>
      <p>Maybe that’s why he laughs so much, because he isn’t able to keep all the pieces out.</p>
      <p>He conducts these tours—serious women in blazer jackets, nodding to him as he points out how</p>
      <p>much things have improved over the years. He points out the TV, the big leather chairs, the sanitary</p>
      <p>drinking fountains; then they all go have coffee in the Nurse’s Station. Sometimes he’ll be by himself</p>
      <p>and just  stand in the middle of the day room and clap his hands (you can hear they are wet), clap</p>
      <p>them two or three times till they stick, then hold them prayer-like together under one of his chins</p>
      <p>and start spinning. Spin round and around there in the middle of the floor, looking wild and frantic</p>
      <p>at the TV, the new pictures on the walls, the sanitary drinking fountain. And laughing.</p>
      <p>What he sees that’s so funny he don’t ever let us in on, and the only thing I can see funny is him</p>
      <p>spinning round and around out there like a rubber toy—if you push him over he’s weighted on the</p>
      <p>bottom and straightaway rocks back upright, goes  to spinning again. He never, never looks  at the</p>
      <p>men’s faces. ...</p>
      <p>Ten-forty, -forty-five, -fifty, patients shuttle in and out to appointments in ET or OT or PT, or in</p>
      <p>queer little rooms somewhere where the walls are never the same size and the floors aren’t level. The</p>
      <p>machinery sounds about you reach a steady cruising speed.</p>
      <p>The ward hums the way I heard a cotton mill hum once when the football team played a high</p>
      <p>school  in  California.  After  a  good  season  one  year  the  boosters  in  the  town  were  so  proud  and</p>
      <p>carried away that they paid to fly us to California to play a championship high-school team down</p>
      <p>there. When we flew into the town we had to go visit some local industry. Our coach was one for</p>
      <p>convincing folks that athletics was educational because of the learning afforded by travel, and every</p>
      <p>trip  we  took  he  herded  the  team  around  to  creameries  and  beet  farms  and  canneries  before  the</p>
      <p>game. In California it was the cotton mill. When we went in the mill most of the team took a look</p>
      <p>and left to go sit in the bus over stud games on suitcases, but I stayed inside over in a corner out of</p>
      <p>the way of the Negro girls running up and down the aisles of machines. The [39] mill put me in a</p>
      <p>kind of dream, all the humming and clicking and rattling of people and machinery, jerking around in</p>
      <p>a pattern. That’s why I stayed when the others left, that, and because it reminded me somehow of</p>
      <p>the men in the tribe who’d left the village in the last days to do work on the gravel crusher for the</p>
      <p>dam. The frenzied pattern, the faces hypnotized by routine ... I wanted to go out in the bus with the</p>
      <p>team, but I couldn’t.</p>
      <p>It  was  morning  in  early  winter  and  I  still  had  on  the  jacket  they’d  given  us  when  we  took  the</p>
      <p>championship—a red and green jacket with leather sleeves and a football-shaped emblem sewn on</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>24</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>the back telling what we’d won—and it was making a lot of the Negro girls stare. I took it off, but</p>
      <p>they kept staring. I was a whole lot bigger in those days.</p>
      <p>One of the girls left her machine and looked back and forth up the aisles to see if the foreman</p>
      <p>was  around,  then  came  over  to  where  I  was  standing.  She  asked  if  we  was  going  to play  the high</p>
      <p>school  that  night  and  she  told  me  she  had  a  brother  played  tailback  for  them.  We  talked  a  piece</p>
      <p>about football and the like and I noticed how her face looked blurred, like there was a mist between</p>
      <p>me and her. It was the cotton fluff sifting from the air.</p>
      <p>I told her about the fluff. She rolled her eyes and ducked her mouth to laugh in her fist when I</p>
      <p>told  her  how  it  was  like  looking  at  her  face  out  on  a  misty  morning  duck-hunting.  And  she  said,</p>
      <p>“Now what in the everlovin’ world would you want with me out alone in a duck blind?” I told her</p>
      <p>she could take care of my gun, and the girls all over the mill went to giggling in their fists. I laughed</p>
      <p>a little myself, seeing how clever I’d been. We were still talking and laughing when she grabbed both</p>
      <p>my wrists and dug in. The features of her face snapped into brilliant focus; I saw she was terrified of</p>
      <p>something.</p>
      <p>“Do,” she said to me in a whisper, “do take me, big boy. Outa this here mill, outa this town, outa</p>
      <p>this life. Take me to some ol’ duck blind someplace. Someplace else. Huh, big boy, huh?”</p>
      <p>Her dark, pretty face glittered there in front of me. I stood with my mouth open, trying to think</p>
      <p>of some way to answer her. We were locked together this way for maybe a couple of seconds; then</p>
      <p>the sound of the mill jumped a hitch, and something commenced to draw her back away from me. A</p>
      <p>string  somewhere  I  didn’t  see  hooked  on  that  flowered  red  skirt  and  was  tugging  her  back.  Her</p>
      <p>fingernails peeled down my hands [40] and as soon as she broke contact with me her face switched</p>
      <p>out of focus again, became soft and runny like melting chocolate behind that blowing fog of cotton.</p>
      <p>She laughed and spun around and gave me a look of her yellow leg when the skirt billowed out. She</p>
      <p>threw me a wink over her shoulder as she ran back to her machine where a pile of fiber was spilling</p>
      <p>off the table to the floor; she grabbed it up and ran feather-footed down the aisle of machines to</p>
      <p>dump the fiber in a hopper; then she was out of sight around the corner.</p>
      <p>All those spindles reeling and wheeling and shuttles jumping around and bobbins wringing the air</p>
      <p>with string, whitewashed walls and steel-gray machines and girls in flowered skirts skipping back and</p>
      <p>forth,  and  the  whole  thing  webbed  with  flowing  white  lines  stringing  the  factory  together—it  all</p>
      <p>stuck with me and every once in a while something on the ward calls it to mind.</p>
      <p>Yes. This is what I know. The ward is a factory for the Combine. It’s for fixing up mistakes made</p>
      <p>in  the  neighborhoods  and  in  the  schools  and  in  the  churches,  the  hospital  is.  When  a  completed</p>
      <p>product goes back out into society, all fixed up good as new, better than new sometimes, it brings joy</p>
      <p>to the Big Nurse’s heart; something that came in all twisted different is now a functioning, adjusted</p>
      <p>component, a credit to the whole outfit and a marvel to behold. Watch him sliding across the land</p>
      <p>with  a  welded  grin,  fitting  into  some  nice  little  neighborhood  where  they’re  just  now  digging</p>
      <p>trenches  along  the  street  to  lay  pipes  for  city  water.  He’s  happy  with  it.  He’s  adjusted  to</p>
      <p>surroundings finally. …</p>
      <p>“Why,  I’ve  never  seen  anything to  beat  the  change  in  Maxwell  Taber  since he’s  got  back  from</p>
      <p>that hospital; a little black and blue around the eyes, a little weight lost, and, you know what? he’s a</p>
      <p>new man. Gad, modern American science ...”</p>
      <p>And  the  light  is  on  in  his  basement  window  way  past  midnight  every  night  as  the  Delayed</p>
      <p>Reaction  Elements  the  technicians  installed  lend  nimble  skills  to  his  fingers  as  he  bends  over  the</p>
      <p>doped  figure  of  his  wife,  his  two  little  girls  just  four  and  six,  the  neighbor  he  goes  bowling  with</p>
      <p>Mondays; he adjusts them like he was adjusted. This is the way they spread it.</p>
      <p>When he finally runs down after a pre-set number of years, the town loves him dearly and the</p>
      <p>paper prints his picture helping the Boy Scouts last year on Graveyard Cleaning Day, and his wife</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>25</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>gets a letter from the principal of the high school how Maxwell Wilson Taber was an inspirational</p>
      <p>figure to the youth of our fine community.</p>
      <p>Even the embalmers, usually a pair of penny-pinching [41] tightwads, are swayed. “Yeah, look at</p>
      <p>him there: old Max Taber, he was a good sort. What do you say we use that expensive thirty-weight</p>
      <p>at no extra charge to his wife. No, what the dickens, let’s make it on the house.”</p>
      <p>A successful Dismissal like this is a product brings joy to the Big Nurse’s heart and speaks good</p>
      <p>of her craft and the whole industry in general. Everybody’s happy with a Dismissal.</p>
      <p>But an Admission is a different story. Even the best-behaved Admission is bound to need some</p>
      <p>work  to  swing  into  routine,  and,  also,  you never can  tell  when  just  that certain  one might come  in</p>
      <p>who’s free enough to foul things up right and left, really make a hell of a mess and constitute a threat</p>
      <p>to the whole smoothness of the outfit. And, like I explain, the Big Nurse gets real put out if anything</p>
      <p>keeps her outfit from running smooth.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>26</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>5</p>
      <p>Before noontime they’re at the fog machine again but they haven’t got it turned up full; it’s not so</p>
      <p>thick but what I can see if I strain real hard. One of these days I’ll quit straining and let myself go</p>
      <p>completely, lose myself in the fog the way some of the other Chronics have, but for the time being</p>
      <p>I’m interested in this new man—I want to see how he takes to the Group Meeting coming up.</p>
      <p>Ten minutes to one the fog dissolves completely and the black boys are telling Acutes to clear the</p>
      <p>floor  for  the  meeting.  All  the  tables  are  carried  out  of  the  day  room  to  the  tub  room  across  the</p>
      <p>hall—leaves the floor, McMurphy says, like we was aiming to have us a little dance.</p>
      <p>The Big Nurse watches all this through her window. She hasn’t moved from her spot in front of</p>
      <p>that  one  window  for  three  solid  hours,  not  even  for  lunch.  The  day-room  floor  gets  cleared  of</p>
      <p>tables, and at one o’clock the doctor comes out of his office down the hall, nods once at the nurse</p>
      <p>as he goes past where she’s watching out her window, and sits in his chair just to the left of the door.</p>
      <p>The  patients  sit  down  when  he  does;  then  the  little  nurses  and  the  residents  straggle  in.  When</p>
      <p>everybody’s down, the Big Nurse gets up from behind her window and goes back to the rear of the</p>
      <p>Nurses’ Station to that steel panel with dials and buttons on it, sets some kind of automatic pilot to</p>
      <p>run things while she’s away, and comes out into the day room, carrying the log book and a basketful</p>
      <p>of notes. Her uniform, even after she’s been here half a day, is still starched so stiff it don’t exactly</p>
      <p>bend any place; it cracks sharp at the joints with a sound like a frozen canvas being folded.</p>
      <p>She sits just to the right of the door.</p>
      <p>Soon as she’s sat down, Old Pete Bancini sways to his feet and starts  in wagging his head  and</p>
      <p>wheezing.  “I’m  tired.  Whew.  O  Lord.  Oh,  I’m  awful  tired  ...”  the  way  he  always  does  whenever</p>
      <p>there’s a new man on the ward who might listen to him.</p>
      <p>The  Big  Nurse  doesn’t  look  over  at  Pete.  She’s  going  through  the  papers  in  her  basket.</p>
      <p>“Somebody go sit beside Mr. Bancini,” she says. “Quiet him down so we can start the meeting.”</p>
      <p>[43] Billy Bibbit goes. Pete has turned facing McMurphy and is lolling his head from side to side</p>
      <p>like a signal light at a railroad crossing. He worked on the railroad thirty years; now he’s wore clean</p>
      <p>out but still’s functioning on the memory.</p>
      <p>“I’m  ti-i-uhd,”  he  says,  wagging  his  face  at  McMurphy.  “Take  it  easy,  Pete,”  Billy  says,  lays  a</p>
      <p>freckled hand on Pete’s knee.</p>
      <p>“… Awful tired ...”</p>
      <p>“I know, Pete”—pats the skinny knee, and Pete pulls back his face, realizes nobody is going to</p>
      <p>heed his complaint today. The nurse takes off her wrist watch and looks at the ward clock and winds</p>
      <p>the watch and sets it face toward her in the basket. She takes a folder from the basket.</p>
      <p>“Now. Shall we get into the meeting?”</p>
      <p>She looks around to see if anybody else is about to interrupt her, smiling steady as her head turns</p>
      <p>in  her  collar.  The  guys  won’t  meet  her  look;  they’re  all  looking  for  hangnails.  Except  McMurphy.</p>
      <p>He’s got himself an armchair in the corner, sits in it like he’s claimed it for good, and he’s watching</p>
      <p>her every move. He’s still got his cap on, jammed tight down on his red head like he’s a motorcycle</p>
      <p>racer. A deck of cards in his lap opens for a one-handed cut, then clacks shut with a sound blown up</p>
      <p>loud by the silence. The nurse’s swinging eyes hang on him for a second. She’s been watching him</p>
      <p>play  poker  all  morning  and  though  she  hasn’t  seen  any  money  pass  hands  she  suspects  he’s  not</p>
      <p>exactly the type that is going to be happy with the ward rule of gambling for matches only. The deck</p>
      <p>whispers open and clacks shut again and then disappears somewhere in one of those big palms.</p>
      <p>The nurse looks at her watch again and pulls a slip of paper out of the folder she’s holding, looks</p>
      <p>at it, and returns it to the folder. She puts the folder down and picks up the log book. Ellis coughs</p>
      <p>from his place on the wall; she waits until he stops.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>27</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Now.  At  the  close  of  Friday’s  meeting  ...  we  were  discussing  Mr.  Harding’s  problem  ...</p>
      <p>concerning his young wife. He had stated that his wife was extremely well endowed in the bosom</p>
      <p>and that this made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street.” She starts opening</p>
      <p>to places in the log book; little slips of paper stick out of the top of the book to mark the pages.</p>
      <p>“According to the notes listed by various patients in the log, Mr. Harding has been heard to say that</p>
      <p>she ‘damn well gives the bastards reason to stare.’ He has also been heard to say that he may give her</p>
      <p>reason to seek further sexual attention. He has been heard to say, ‘My dear [44] sweet but illiterate</p>
      <p>wife thinks any word or gesture that does not smack of brickyard brawn and brutality is a word or</p>
      <p>gesture of weak dandyism.’ ”</p>
      <p>She continues reading silently from the book for a while, then closes it.</p>
      <p>“He  has  also  stated  that his  wife’s  ample  bosom  at  times  gives  him  a  feeling  of  inferiority.  So.</p>
      <p>Does anyone care to touch upon this subject further?”</p>
      <p>Harding  shuts  his  eyes,  and  nobody  else  says  anything.  McMurphy  looks  around  at  the  other</p>
      <p>guys, waiting to see if anybody is going to answer the nurse, then holds his hand up and snaps his</p>
      <p>fingers, like a school kid in class; the nurse nods at him.</p>
      <p>“Mr.—ah—McMurry?”</p>
      <p>“Touch upon what?”</p>
      <p>“What? Touch—”</p>
      <p>“You ask, I believe, ‘Does anyone care to touch upon—’ ”</p>
      <p>“Touch upon the—subject, Mr. McMurry, the subject of Mr. Harding’s problem with his wife.”</p>
      <p>“Oh. I thought you mean touch upon her—something else.”</p>
      <p>“Now what could you—”</p>
      <p>But she stops. She was almost flustered for a second there. Some of the Acutes hide grins, and</p>
      <p>McMurphy takes a huge stretch, yawns, winks at Harding. Then the nurse, calm as anything, puts the</p>
      <p>log book back in the basket and takes out another folder and opens it and starts reading.</p>
      <p>“McMurry, Randle Patrick. Committed by the state from the Pendleton Farm for Correction. For</p>
      <p>diagnosis and possible treatment. Thirty-five years old. Never married. Distinguished Service Cross</p>
      <p>in  Korea,  for  leading  an  escape  from  a  Communist  prison  camp.  A  dishonorable  discharge,</p>
      <p>afterward,  for  insubordination.  Followed  by  a  history  of  street  brawls  and  barroom  fights  and  a</p>
      <p>series of arrests for Drunkenness, Assault and Battery, Disturbing the Peace, repeated gambling, and</p>
      <p>one arrest—for Rape.”</p>
      <p>“Rape?” The doctor perks up.</p>
      <p>“Statutory, with a girl of—”</p>
      <p>“Whoa. Couldn’t make that stick,” McMurphy says to the doctor. “Girl wouldn’t testify.”</p>
      <p>“With a child of fifteen.”</p>
      <p>“Said  she  was  seventeen,  Doc,  and  she  was  plenty  willin’.”  “A  court  doctor’s  examination  of  the</p>
      <p>child proved entry, repeated entry, the record states—”</p>
      <p>“So willin’, in fact, I took to sewing my pants shut.”</p>
      <p>“The  child  refused  to  testify  in  spite  of  the  doctor’s  findings.  [45]  There  seemed  to  be</p>
      <p>intimidation. Defendant left town shortly after the trial.”</p>
      <p>“Hoo  boy,  I  had  to  leave.  Doc,  let  me  tell  you”—he  leans  forward  with  an  elbow  on  a  knee,</p>
      <p>lowering his voice to the doctor across the room—“that little hustler would of actually burnt me to a</p>
      <p>frazzle by the time she reached legal sixteen. She got to where she was tripping me and beating me</p>
      <p>to the floor.”</p>
      <p>The  nurse  closes  up  the  folder  and  passes  it  across  the  doorway  to  the  doctor.  “Our  new</p>
      <p>Admission, Doctor Spivey,” just like she’s got a man folded up inside that yellow paper and can pass</p>
      <p>him on to be looked over. “I thought I might brief you on his record later today, but as he seems to</p>
      <p>insist on asserting himself in the Group Meeting, we might as well dispense with him now.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>28</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>The doctor fishes his glasses  from his coat pocket by pulling on the string, works them on his</p>
      <p>nose  in  front  of his  eyes.  They’re tipped  a  little  to the right, but he  leans his  head  to the  left  and</p>
      <p>brings  them  level.  He’s  smiling  a  little  as  he  turns  through  the  folder,  just  as  tickled  by  this  new</p>
      <p>man’s brassy way of talking right up as the rest of us, but, just like the rest of us, he’s careful not to</p>
      <p>let himself come right out and laugh. The doctor closes the folder when he gets to the end, and puts</p>
      <p>his glasses back in his pocket. He looks to where McMurphy is still leaned out at him from across</p>
      <p>the day room.</p>
      <p>“You’ve—it seems—no other psychiatric history, Mr. McMurry?”</p>
      <p>“McMurphy, Doc.”</p>
      <p>“Oh? But I thought—the nurse was saying—”</p>
      <p>He  opens  the  folder  again,  fishes  out  those  glasses,  looks  the  record  over  for  another  minute</p>
      <p>before he closes it, and puts his glasses back in his pocket. “Yes. McMurphy. That is correct. I beg</p>
      <p>your pardon.”</p>
      <p>“It’s okay, Doc. It was the lady there that started it, made the mistake. I’ve known some people</p>
      <p>inclined to do that. I had this uncle whose name was Hallahan, and he went with a woman once who</p>
      <p>kept acting like she couldn’t remember his name right and calling him Hooligan just to get his goat.</p>
      <p>It went on for months before he stopped her. Stopped her good, too.”</p>
      <p>“Oh? How did he stop her?” the doctor asks.</p>
      <p>McMurphy grins and rubs his nose with his thumb. “Ah-ah, now, I can’t be tellin’ that. I keep</p>
      <p>Unk Hallahan’s method a strict secret, you see, in case I need to use it myself someday.”</p>
      <p>He says it right at the nurse. She smiles right back at him, [46] and he looks over at the doctor.</p>
      <p>“Now; what was you asking about my record, Doc?”</p>
      <p>“Yes. I was wondering if you’ve any previous psychiatric history. Any analysis, any time spent in</p>
      <p>any other institution?”</p>
      <p>“Well, counting state and county coolers—”</p>
      <p>“Mental institutions.”</p>
      <p>“Ah. No, if that’s the case. This is my first trip. But I am crazy, Doc. I swear I am. Well here—let</p>
      <p>me show you here. I believe that other doctor at the work farm ...”</p>
      <p>He gets up, slips the deck of cards in the pocket of his jacket, and comes across the room to lean</p>
      <p>over the doctor’s shoulder and thumb through the folder in his lap. “Believe he wrote something,</p>
      <p>back at the back here somewhere ...”</p>
      <p>“Yes? I missed that. Just a moment.” The doctor fishes his glasses out again and puts them on</p>
      <p>and looks to where McMurphy is pointing.</p>
      <p>“Right here, Doc. The nurse left this part out while she was summarizing my record. Where it says,</p>
      <p>‘Mr.  McMurphy  has  evidenced  repeated’—I  just  want  to  make  sure  I’m  understood  completely,</p>
      <p>Doc—‘repeated outbreaks of passion that suggest the possible diagnosis of psychopath.’ He told me</p>
      <p>that’psychopath’ means I fight and fuh—pardon me, ladies—means I am he put it overzealous in my</p>
      <p>sexual relations. Doctor, is that real serious?”</p>
      <p>He asks it with such a little-boy look of worry and concern all over his broad, tough face that the</p>
      <p>doctor can’t help bending his head to hide another little snicker in his collar, and his glasses fall from</p>
      <p>his nose dead center back in his pocket. All of the Acutes are smiling too, now, and even some of</p>
      <p>the Chronics.</p>
      <p>“I mean that overzealousness, Doc, have you ever been troubled by it?”</p>
      <p>The doctor wipes his eyes. “No, Mr. McMurphy, I’ll admit I haven’t. I am interested, however,</p>
      <p>that the doctor at the work farm added this statement: ‘Don’t overlook the possibility that this man</p>
      <p>might be feigning psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm.’ ” He looks up at McMurphy.</p>
      <p>“And what about that, Mr. McMurphy?”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>29</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Doctor”—he stands up to his full height, wrinkles his forehead, and holds out both arms, open</p>
      <p>and honest to all the wide world—”do I look like a sane man?”</p>
      <p>The  doctor  is  working  so  hard to  keep  from  giggling  again  he  can’t  answer. McMurphy pivots</p>
      <p>away from the doctor and asks the same thing of the Big Nurse: “Do I?” Instead of answering she</p>
      <p>stands up and takes the manila folder away from [47] the doctor and puts it back in the basket under</p>
      <p>her watch. She sits back down.</p>
      <p>“Perhaps, Doctor, you should advise Mr. McMurry on the protocol of these Group Meetings.”</p>
      <p>“Ma’am,” McMurphy says, “have I told you about my uncle Hallahan and the woman who used</p>
      <p>to screw up his name?”</p>
      <p>She  looks  at  him  for  a  long  time  without  her  smile.  She  has  the  ability  to  turn  her  smile  into</p>
      <p>whatever expression she wants to use on somebody, but the look she turns it into is no different,</p>
      <p>just  a  calculated  and  mechanical  expression  to  serve  her  purpose.  Finally  she  says,  “I  beg  your</p>
      <p>pardon, Mack-Murph-y.” She turns back to the doctor. “Now, Doctor, if you would explain ...”</p>
      <p>The  doctor  folds  his  hands  and  leans  back.  “Yes.  I  suppose  What  I  should  do  is  explain  the</p>
      <p>complete theory of our Therapeutic Community, while we’re at it. Though I usually save it until later.</p>
      <p>Yes. A good idea, Miss Ratched, a fine idea.”</p>
      <p>“Certainly the theory too, doctor, but what I had in mind was the rule, that the patients remain</p>
      <p>seated during the course of the meeting,”</p>
      <p>“Yes. Of course. Then I will explain the theory. Mr. McMurphy, one of the first things is that the</p>
      <p>patients  remain  seated  during  the  course  of  the  meeting.  It’s  the  only  way,  you  see,  for  us  to</p>
      <p>maintain order.”</p>
      <p>“Sure, Doctor. I just got up to show you that thing in my record book.”</p>
      <p>He goes over to his chair, gives another big stretch and yawn, sits down, and moves around for a</p>
      <p>while like a dog coming to rest. When he’s comfortable, he looks over at the doctor, waiting.</p>
      <p>“As to the theory ...” The doctor takes a deep, happy breath.</p>
      <p>“Ffffuck da wife,” Ruckly says. McMurphy hides his mouth behind the back of his hand and calls</p>
      <p>across the ward to Ruckly in a scratchy whisper, “Whose wife?” and Martini’s head snaps up, eyes</p>
      <p>wide and staring. “Yeah,” he says, “whose wife? Oh. Her? Yeah, I see her. Yeah.”</p>
      <p>“I’d give a lot to have that man’s eyes,” McMurphy says of Martini and then doesn’t say anything</p>
      <p>all the rest of the meeting. Just sits  and watches and doesn’t miss a thing that happens or a word</p>
      <p>that’s said. The doctor talks about his theory until the Big Nurse finally decides he’s used up time</p>
      <p>enough and asks him to hush so they can get on to Harding, and they talk the rest of the meeting</p>
      <p>about that.</p>
      <p>McMurphy sits forward in his chair a couple of times during [48] the meeting like he might have</p>
      <p>something to say, but he decides better and leans back. There’s a puzzled expression coming over</p>
      <p>his  face.  Something  strange  is  going  on  here, he’s finding  out.  He  can’t  quite  put his  finger  on  it.</p>
      <p>Like the way nobody will laugh. Now he thought sure there would be a laugh when he asked Ruckly,</p>
      <p>“Whose wife?” but there wasn’t even a sign of one. The air is pressed in by the walls, too tight for</p>
      <p>laughing.  There’s  something  strange  about  a  place  where  the  men  won’t  let  themselves  loose  and</p>
      <p>laugh, something strange about the way they all knuckle under to that smiling flour-faced old mother</p>
      <p>there  with the too-red  lipstick  and  the  too-big  boobs.  And he thinks  he’ll  just  wait  a  while  to  see</p>
      <p>what the story is in this new place before he makes any kind of play. That’s a good rule for a smart</p>
      <p>gambler: look the game over awhile before you draw yourself a hand.</p>

      <p>I’ve  heard  that  theory  of  the  Therapeutic  Community  enough  times  to  repeat  it  forwards  and</p>
      <p>backwards—how  a  guy  has  to  learn  to  get  along  in  a  group  before  he’ll  be  able  to  function  in  a</p>
      <p>normal  society;  how  the  group  can  help  the  guy  by  showing  him  where  he’s  out  of  place;  how</p>
      <p>society  is  what  decides  who’s  sane  and  who  isn’t,  so  you  got  to  measure  up.  All  that  stuff.  Every</p>

      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>time we get a new patient on the ward the doctor goes into the theory with both feet; it’s pretty near</p>
      <p>the only time he takes things over and runs the meeting. He tells how the goal of the Therapeutic</p>
      <p>Community  is  a  democratic  ward, run  completely by the  patients  and  their  votes,  working  toward</p>
      <p>making  worth-while  citizens  to  turn  back  Outside  onto  the  street.  Any  little  gripe,  any  grievance,</p>
      <p>anything you want changed, he says, should be brought up before the group and discussed instead of</p>
      <p>letting it fester inside of you. Also you should feel at ease in your surroundings to the extent you can</p>
      <p>freely discuss emotional problems in front of patients and staff. Talk, he says, discuss, confess. And</p>
      <p>if you hear a friend say something during the course of your everyday conversation, then list it in the</p>
      <p>log book for the staff to see. It’s not, as the movies call it, “squealing,” it’s helping your fellow. Bring</p>
      <p>these old sins into the open where they can be washed by the sight of all. And participate in Group</p>
      <p>Discussion. Help yourself and your friends probe into the secrets of the subconscious. There should</p>
      <p>be no need for secrets among friends.</p>
      <p>Our intention, he usually ends by saying, is to make this as much like your own democratic, free</p>
      <p>neighborhoods  as  possible—a  little  world  Inside  that  is  a  made-to-scale  prototype  of  [49]  the  big</p>
      <p>world Outside that you will one day be taking your place in again.</p>
      <p>He’s maybe got more to say, but about this point the Big Nurse usually hushes him, and in the</p>
      <p>lull old Pete stands up and wigwags that battered copper-pot head and tells everybody how tired he</p>
      <p>is, and the nurse tells somebody to go hush him up too, so the meeting can continue, and Pete is</p>
      <p>generally hushed and the meeting goes on.</p>
      <p>Once,  just  one  time  that I  can  remember,  four  or five  years  back,  did  it  go  any  different.  The</p>
      <p>doctor had finished his spiel, and the nurse had opened right up with, “Now. Who will start? Let out</p>
      <p>those  old  secrets.”  And  she’d  put  all  the  Acutes  in  a  trance  by  sitting  there  in  silence  for  twenty</p>
      <p>minutes after the question, quiet as an electric alarm about to go off, waiting for somebody to start</p>
      <p>telling something about themselves. Her eyes swept back and forth over them as steady as a turning</p>
      <p>beacon. The day room was clamped silent for twenty long minutes, with all of the patients stunned</p>
      <p>where they sat. When twenty minutes had passed, she looked at her watch and said, “Am I to take it</p>
      <p>that there’s not a man among you that has committed some act that he has never admitted?” She</p>
      <p>reached in the basket for the log book. “Must we go over past history?”</p>
      <p>That triggered something, some acoustic device in the walls, rigged to turn on at just the sound of</p>
      <p>those words coming from her mouth. The Acutes stiffened. Their mouths opened in unison. Her</p>
      <p>sweeping eyes stopped on the first man along the wall.</p>
      <p>His mouth worked. “I robbed a cash register in a service station.”</p>
      <p>She moved to the next man.</p>
      <p>“I tried to take my little sister to bed.”</p>
      <p>Her eyes clicked to the next man; each one jumped like a shooting-gallery target.</p>
      <p>“I—one time—wanted to take my brother to bed.”</p>
      <p>“I killed my cat when I was six. Oh, God forgive me, I stoned her to death and said my neighbor</p>
      <p>did it.”</p>
      <p>“I lied about trying. I did take my sister!”</p>
      <p>“So did I! So did I!”</p>
      <p>“And me! And me!”</p>
      <p>It was better than she’d dreamed. They were all shouting to outdo one another, going further and</p>
      <p>further, no way of stopping, telling things that wouldn’t ever let them look one another in the eye</p>
      <p>again. The nurse nodding at each confession and saying Yes, yes, yes.</p>
      <p>Then old Pete was on his feet. “I’m tired!” was what he [50] shouted, a strong, angry copper tone</p>
      <p>to his voice that no one had ever heard before.</p>
      <p>Everyone  hushed.  They  were  somehow  ashamed.  It  was  as  if  he  had  suddenly  said  something</p>
      <p>that  was  real  and  true  and  important  and  it had  put  all  their  childish  hollering  to  shame.  The  Big</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>31</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>Nurse was furious. She swiveled and glared at him, the smile dripping over her chin; she’d just had it</p>
      <p>going so good.</p>
      <p>“Somebody see to poor Mr. Bancini,” she said.</p>
      <p>Two or three got up. They tried to soothe him, pat him on his shoulder. But Pete wasn’t being</p>
      <p>hushed. “Tired! Tired!” he kept on.</p>
      <p>Finally the nurse sent one of the black boys to take him out of the day room by force. She forgot</p>
      <p>that the black boys didn’t hold any control over people like Pete.</p>
      <p>Pete’s been a Chronic all his life. Even though he didn’t come into the hospital till he was better</p>
      <p>than  fifty,  he’d  always  been  a  Chronic.  His  head  has  two  big  dents,  one  on  each  side,  where  the</p>
      <p>doctor who was with his mother at horning time pinched his skull trying to pull him out. Pete had</p>
      <p>looked  out  first  and  seer.  all  the  delivery-room  machinery  waiting  for  him  and  somehow  realized</p>
      <p>what he was being born into, and had grabbed on to everything handy in there to try to stave off</p>
      <p>being born. The doctor reached in and got him by the head with a set of dulled ice tongs and jerked</p>
      <p>him loose and figured everything was all right. But Pete’s head was still too new, and soft as clay,</p>
      <p>and when it set, those two dents left by the tongs stayed. And this made him simple to where it took</p>
      <p>all his straining effort and concentration and will power just to do the tasks that came easy to a kid</p>
      <p>of six.</p>
      <p>But  one  good  thing—being  simple  like  that  put  him  out  of  the  clutch  of  the  Combine.  They</p>
      <p>weren’t able to mold him into a slot. So they let him get a simple job on the railroad, where all he</p>
      <p>had to do was sit in a little clapboard house way out in the sticks on a lonely switch and wave a red</p>
      <p>lantern at the trains if the switch was one way, and a green one if it was the other, and a yellow one</p>
      <p>if there was a train someplace up ahead. And he did it, with main force and a gutpower they couldn’t</p>
      <p>mash out of his head, out by himself on that switch. And he never had any controls installed.</p>
      <p>That’s  why the  black  boy  didn’t  have  any  say  over  him.  But the  black  boy  didn’t think of  that</p>
      <p>right  off  any  more  than  the  nurse  did  when  she  ordered  Pete  removed  from  the  day  room.  The</p>
      <p>black boy walked right up and gave Pete’s arm a jerk [51] toward the door, just like you’d jerk the</p>
      <p>reins on a plow horse to turn him.</p>
      <p>“Tha’s right, Pete. Less go to the dorm. You disturbin’ ever’body.”</p>
      <p>Pete shook his arm loose. “I’m tired,” he warned.</p>
      <p>“C’mon, old man, you makin’ a fuss. Less us go to bed and be still like a good boy.”</p>
      <p>“Tired ...”</p>
      <p>“I said you goin’ to the dorm, old man!”</p>
      <p>The  black  boy  jerked  at  his  arm  again,  and  Pete  stopped  wigwagging  his  head.  He  stood  up</p>
      <p>straight and steady, and his eyes snapped clear. Usually Pete’s eyes are half shut and all murked up,</p>
      <p>like there’s milk in them, but this time they came clear as blue neon. And the hand on that arm the</p>
      <p>black boy was holding commenced to swell up. The staff and most of the rest of the patients were</p>
      <p>talking  among  themselves,  not  paying  any  attention  to  this  old  guy  and  his  old  song  about  being</p>
      <p>tired, figuring he’d be quieted down as usual and the meeting would go on. They didn’t see the hand</p>
      <p>on the end of that arm pumping bigger and bigger as he clenched and unclenched it. I was the only</p>
      <p>one saw it. I saw it swell and clench shut, flow in front of my eyes, become smooth—hard. A big</p>
      <p>rusty iron ball at the end of a chain. I stared at it and waited, while the black boy gave Pete’s arm</p>
      <p>another jerk toward the dorm.</p>
      <p>“Ol’ man, I say you got—”</p>
      <p>He saw the hand. He tried to edge back away from it, saying, “You a good boy, Peter,” but he</p>
      <p>was a shade too late. Pete had that big iron ball swinging all the way from his knees. The black boy</p>
      <p>whammed flat against the wall and stuck, then slid down to the floor like the wall there was greased.</p>
      <p>I heard tubes pop and short all over inside that wall, and the plaster cracked just the shape of how</p>
      <p>he hit.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>32</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>The  other  two—the  least  one  and  the  other  big  one—stood  stunned.  The  nurse  snapped  her</p>
      <p>fingers,  and  they  sprang  into  motion.  Instant  movement,  sliding  across  the  floor.  The  little  one</p>
      <p>beside  the  other  like  an  image  in  a  reducing  mirror.  They  were  almost  to  Pete  when  it  suddenly</p>
      <p>struck them what the other boy should of known, that Pete wasn’t wired under control like the rest</p>
      <p>of us, that he wasn’t about to mind just because they gave him an order or gave his arm a jerk. If</p>
      <p>they were to take him they’d have to take him like you take a wild bear or bull, and with one of their</p>
      <p>number out cold against the baseboards, the other two black boys didn’t care for the odds.</p>
      <p>[52] This thought got them both at once and they froze, the big one and his tiny image, in exactly</p>
      <p>the same position, left foot forward, right hand out, halfway between Pete and the Big Nurse. That</p>
      <p>iron ball swinging in front of them and that snowwhite anger behind them, they shook and smoked</p>
      <p>and I could hear gears grinding. I could see them twitch with confusion, like machines throttled full</p>
      <p>ahead and with the brake on.</p>
      <p>Pete stood there in the middle of the floor, swinging that ball back and forth at his side, all leaned</p>
      <p>over to its weight. Everybody was watching him now. He looked from the big black boy to the little</p>
      <p>one, and when he saw they weren’t about to come any closer he turned to the patients.</p>
      <p>“You see—it’s a lotta baloney,” he told them, “it’s all a lotta baloney.”</p>
      <p>The  Big  Nurse  had  slid  from  her  chair  and  was  working  toward  her  wicker  bag  leaning  at  the</p>
      <p>door. “Yes, yes, Mr. Bancini,” she crooned, “now if you’ll just be calm—”</p>
      <p>“That’s  all  it  is,  nothin’  but  a  lotta  baloney.”  His  voice  lost  its  copper  strength  and  became</p>
      <p>strained and urgent like he didn’t have much time to finish what he had to say. “Ya see, I can’t help</p>
      <p>it, I can’t—don’t ya see. I was born dead. Not you. You wasn’t born dead. Ahhhh, it’s been hard ...”</p>
      <p>He started to cry. He couldn’t make the words come out right anymore; he opened and closed his</p>
      <p>mouth to talk but he couldn’t sort the words into sentences any more. He shook his head to clear it</p>
      <p>and blinked at the Acutes:</p>
      <p>“Ahhhh, I ... tell ... ya ... I tell you.”</p>
      <p>He began slumping over again, and his iron ball shrank back to a hand. He held it cupped out in</p>
      <p>front of him like he was offering something to the patients.</p>
      <p>“I can’t help it. I was born a miscarriage. I had so many insults I died. I was born dead. I can’t</p>
      <p>help it. I’m tired. I’m give out trying. You got chances. I had so many insults I was born dead. You</p>
      <p>got it easy. I was born dead an’ life was hard. I’m tired. I’m tired out talking and standing up. I been</p>
      <p>dead fifty-five years.”</p>
      <p>The Big Nurse got him clear across the room, right through his greens. She jumped back without</p>
      <p>getting the needle pulled out after the shot and it hung there from his pants like a little tail of glass</p>
      <p>and steel, old Pete slumping farther and farther forward, not from the shot but from the effort; the</p>
      <p>last couple of minutes had  worn him out finally and completely, once and for all—you could  just</p>
      <p>look at him and tell he was finished.</p>
      <p>So there wasn’t really any need for the shot; his head had already commenced to wag back and</p>
      <p>forth and his eyes were [53] murky. By the time the nurse eased back in to get the needle he was</p>
      <p>bent so far forward he was crying directly on the floor without wetting his face, tears spotting a wide</p>
      <p>area  as  he  swung  his  head  back  and  forth,  spatting,  spatting,  in  an  even  pattern  on  the  day-room</p>
      <p>floor, like he was sowing them. “Ahhhhh,” he said. He didn’t flinch when she jerked the needle out.</p>
      <p>He had come to life for maybe a minute to try to tell us something, something none of us cared</p>
      <p>to listen to or tried to understand, and the effort had drained him dry. That shot in his hip was as</p>
      <p>wasted as if she’d squirted it in a dead man—no heart to pump it, no vein to carry it up to his head,</p>
      <p>no  brain  up  there  for  it  to  mortify  with  its  poison.  She’d  just  as  well  shot  it  in  a  dried-out  old</p>
      <p>cadaver.</p>
      <p>“I’m ... tired ...”</p>
      <p>“Now. I think if you two boys are brave enough, Mr. Bancini will go to bed like a good fellow.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>33</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“... aw-ful tired.”</p>
      <p>“And Aide Williams is coming around, Doctor Spivey. See to him, won’t you. Here. His watch is</p>
      <p>broken and he’s cut his arm.”</p>
      <p>Pete never tried anything like that again, and he never will. Now, when he starts acting up during</p>
      <p>a meeting and they try to hush him, he always hushes. He’ll still get up from time to time and wag</p>
      <p>his head and let us know how tired he is, but it’s not a complaint or excuse or warning any more—</p>
      <p>he’s  finished  with  that;  it’s  like  an  old  clock  that  won’t  tell  time  but  won’t  stop  neither,  with  the</p>
      <p>hands  bent  out  of  shape  and  the  face  bare  of  numbers  and  the  alarm  bell  rusted  silent,  an  old,</p>
      <p>worthless clock that just keeps ticking and cuckooing without meaning nothing.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>The group is still tearing into poor Harding when two o’clock rolls around.</p>
      <p>At two o’clock the doctor begins to squirm around in his chair. The meetings are uncomfortable</p>
      <p>for  the  doctor  unless  he’s talking  about  his  theory;  he’d  rather  spend  his  time  down  in  his  office,</p>
      <p>drawing on graphs. He squirms around and finally clears his tbroat, and the nurse looks at her watch</p>
      <p>and tells us to bring the tables back in from the tub room and we’ll resume this discussion again at</p>
      <p>one tomorrow. The Acutes click out of their trance, look for an instant in Harding’s direction. Their</p>
      <p>faces burn with a shame like they have just woke up to the fact they been played for suckers again.</p>
      <p>Some of them go to the tub room across the hall to get the tables, some [54] wander over to the</p>
      <p>magazine racks and show a lot of interest in the old McCall’s magazines, but what they’re all really</p>
      <p>doing is avoiding Harding. They’ve been maneuvered again into grilling one of their friends like he</p>
      <p>was  a criminal  and they were all prosecutors and judge and  jury. For forty-five minutes they been</p>
      <p>chopping a man to pieces, almost as if they enjoyed it, shooting questions at him: What’s he think is</p>
      <p>the matter with him that he can’t please the little lady; why’s he insist she has never had anything to</p>
      <p>do  with  another  man;  how’s  he  expect  to  get  well  if  he  doesn’t  answer  honestly?—questions  and</p>
      <p>insinuations till now they feel bad about it and they don’t want to be made more uncomfortable by</p>
      <p>being near him.</p>
      <p>McMurphy’s eyes follow all of this. He doesn’t get out of his chair. He looks puzzled again. He</p>
      <p>sits in his chair for a while, watching the Acutes, scuffing that deck of cards up and down the red</p>
      <p>stubble on his chin, then finally stands up from his arm chair, yawns and stretches and scratches his</p>
      <p>belly  button  with  a  corner  of  a  card,  then  puts  the  deck  in  his  pocket  and  walks  over  to  where</p>
      <p>Harding is off by himself, sweated to his chair.</p>
      <p>McMurphy looks down at Harding a minute, then laps his big hand over the back of a nearby</p>
      <p>wooden chair, swings it around so the back is facing Harding, and straddles it  like he’d straddle a</p>
      <p>tiny horse. Harding hasn’t noticed a thing. McMurphy slaps his pockets till he finds his cigarettes,</p>
      <p>and takes one out and lights it; he holds it out in front of him and frowns at the tip, licks his thumb</p>
      <p>and finger, and arranges the fire to suit him.</p>
      <p>Each  man  seems  unaware  of  the other.  I  can’t even  tell  if  Harding’s  noticed  McMurphy  at  all.</p>
      <p>Harding’s  got  his  thin  shoulders  folded  nearly together  around himself,  like  green  wings,  and  he’s</p>
      <p>sitting very straight near the edge of his chair, with his hands trapped between his knees. He’s staring</p>
      <p>straight ahead, humming to himself, trying to look calm—but he’s chewing at his cheeks, and this</p>
      <p>gives him a funny skull grin, not calm at all.</p>
      <p>McMurphy puts his cigarette back between his teeth and folds his hands over the wooden chair</p>
      <p>back and leans his chin on them, squinting one eye against the smoke. He looks at Harding with his</p>
      <p>other eye a while, then starts talking with that cigarette wagging up and down in his lips.</p>
      <p>“Well say, buddy, is this the way these leetle meetings usually go?”</p>
      <p>“Usually go?” Harding’s humming stops. He’s not chewing [55] his cheeks any more but he still</p>
      <p>stares ahead, past McMurphy’s shoulder.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>34</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Is this the usual pro-cedure for these Group Ther’py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin’</p>
      <p>party?”</p>
      <p>Harding’s head turns with a jerk and his eyes find McMurphy, like it’s the first time he knows that</p>
      <p>anybody’s sitting in front of him. His face creases in the middle when he bites his cheeks again, and</p>
      <p>this makes it look like he’s grinning. He pulls his shoulders back and scoots to the back of the chair</p>
      <p>and tries to look relaxed.</p>
      <p>“A ‘pecking party’? I fear your quaint down-home speech is wasted on me, my friend. I have not</p>
      <p>the slightest inclination what you’re talking about.”</p>
      <p>“Why then, I’ll just explain it to you.” McMurphy raises his voice; though he doesn’t look at the</p>
      <p>other Acutes listening behind him, it’s them he’s talking to. “The flock gets sight of a spot of blood</p>
      <p>on some chicken and they all  go to peckin’ at  it, see, till they rip the chicken to shreds, blood and</p>
      <p>bones and feathers. But usually a couple of the flock gets spotted in the fracas, then it’s their turn.</p>
      <p>And a few more gets spots and gets pecked to death, and more and more. Oh, a peckin’ party can</p>
      <p>wipe out the whole flock in a matter of a few hours, buddy, I seen it. A mighty awesome sight. The</p>
      <p>only way to prevent it—with chickens—is to clip blinders on them. So’s they can’t see.”</p>
      <p>Harding laces his long fingers around a knee and draws the knee toward him, leaning back in the</p>
      <p>chair. “A pecking party. That certainly is a pleasant analogy, my friend.”</p>
      <p>“And that’s just exactly what that meeting I just set through reminded me of, buddy, if you want</p>
      <p>to know the dirty truth. It reminded me of a flock of dirty chickens.”</p>
      <p>“So that makes me the chicken with the spot of blood, friend?”</p>
      <p>“That’s right, buddy.”</p>
      <p>They’re still grinning at each other, but their voices have dropped so low and taut I have to sweep</p>
      <p>over closer to them with my broom to hear. The other Acutes are moving up closer too.</p>
      <p>“And you want to know somethin’ else, buddy? You want to know who pecks that first peck?”</p>
      <p>Harding waits for him to go on.</p>
      <p>“It’s that old nurse, that’s who.”</p>
      <p>There’s  a  whine  of  fear  over  the  silence.  I  hear  the  machinery  in  the  walls  catch  and  go  on.</p>
      <p>Harding is having a tough time holding his hands still, but he keeps trying to act calm.</p>
      <p>“So,” he says, “it’s as simple as that, as stupidly simple as [56] that. You’re on our ward six hours</p>
      <p>and have already simplified all the work of Freud, Jung, and Maxwell Jones and summed it up in one</p>
      <p>analogy: it’s a ‘peckin’ party.’ ”</p>
      <p>“I’m  not  talking  about  Fred  Yoong  and  Maxwell  Jones,  buddy,  I’m  just  talking  about  that</p>
      <p>crummy meeting and what that nurse and those other bastards did to you. Did in spades.”</p>
      <p>“Did to me?”</p>
      <p>“That’s right, did. Did you every chance they got. Did you coming and did you going. You must</p>
      <p>of done something to makes a passle of enemies here in this place, buddy, because it seems there’s</p>
      <p>sure a passle got it in for you.”</p>
      <p>“Why,  this  is  incredible.  You  completely  disregard,  completely  overlook  and  disregard  the  fact</p>
      <p>that  what  the  fellows  were  doing today  was  for  my  own benefit?  That  any  question or  discussion</p>
      <p>raised by Miss Ratched or the rest of the staff is done solely for therapeutic reasons? You must not</p>
      <p>have heard a word of Doctor Spivey’s theory of the Therapeutic Community, or not have had the</p>
      <p>education to comprehend it if you did. I’m disappointed in you, my friend, oh, very disappointed. I</p>
      <p>had  judged  from  our  encounter  this  morning  that  you  were  more  intelligent—an  illiterate  clod,</p>
      <p>perhaps,  certainly  a  backwoods  braggart  with  no  more  sensitivity  than  a  goose,  but  basically</p>
      <p>intelligent nevertheless. But, observant and insightful though I usually am, I still make mistakes.”</p>
      <p>“The hell with you, buddy.”</p>
      <p>“Oh,  yes;  I  forgot to  add that I  noticed your primitive  brutality  also  this  morning.  Psychopath</p>
      <p>with definite sadistic tendencies, probably motivated by an unreasoning egomania. Yes. As you see,</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>35</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>all these natural talents certainly qualify you as a competent therapist and render you quite capable of</p>
      <p>criticizing  Miss  Ratched’s  meeting  procedure,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  she  is  a  highly  regarded</p>
      <p>psychiatric  nurse  with  twenty  years  in  the  field.  Yes,  with  your  talent,  my  friend,  you  could  work</p>
      <p>subconscious  miracles,  soothe the  aching  id  and  heal  the  wounded  superego.  You  could  probably</p>
      <p>bring about a cure for the whole ward, Vegetables and all, in six short months, ladies and gentlemen</p>
      <p>or your money back.”</p>
      <p>Instead of rising to the argument, McMurphy just keeps on looking at Harding, finally asks in a</p>
      <p>level voice, “And you really think this crap that went on in the meeting today is bringing about some</p>
      <p>kinda cure, doing some kinda good?”</p>
      <p>“What other reason would we have for submitting ourselves to it, my friend? The staff desires</p>
      <p>our cure as much as we do. They aren’t monsters. Miss Ratched may be a strict middle-aged lady,</p>
      <p>but she’s not some kind of giant monster of [57] the poultry clan, bent on sadistically pecking out</p>
      <p>our eyes. You can’t believe that of her, can you?”</p>
      <p>“No, buddy, not that. She ain’t peckin’ at your eyes. That’s not what she’s peckin’ at.”</p>
      <p>Harding  flinches,  and  I  see  his  hands  begin  to  creep  out  from  between  his  knees  like  white</p>
      <p>spiders from between two moss-covered tree limbs, up the limbs toward the joining at the trunk.</p>
      <p>“Not our eyes?” he says. “Pray, then, where is Miss Ratched pecking, my friend?”</p>
      <p>McMurphy grinned. “Why, don’t you know, buddy?”</p>
      <p>“No, of course I don’t know! I mean, if you insi—”</p>
      <p>“At your balls, buddy, at your everlovin’ balls.”</p>
      <p>The spiders reach the joining at the trunk and settle there, twitching. Harding tries to grin, but his</p>
      <p>face and lips are so white the grin is lost. He stares at McMurphy. McMurphy takes the cigarette out</p>
      <p>of his mouth and repeats what he said.</p>
      <p>“Right  at  your  balls.  No,  that nurse  ain’t  some  kinda  monster  chicken,  buddy,  what  she  is  is  a</p>
      <p>ball-cutter.  I’ve  seen  a  thousand  of  ‘em,  old  and  young,  men  and  women.  Seen  ‘em  all  over  the</p>
      <p>country and in the homes—people who try to make you weak so they can get you to toe the line, to</p>
      <p>follow their rules, to live like they want you to. And the best way to do this, to get you to knuckle</p>
      <p>under, is to weaken you by gettin’ you where it hurts the worst. You ever been kneed in the nuts in a</p>
      <p>brawl, buddy? Stops you cold, don’t it? There’s nothing worse. It makes you sick, it saps every bit of</p>
      <p>strength  you  got.  If  you’re  up  against  a  guy  who  wants  to  win  by  making  you  weaker  instead  of</p>
      <p>making himself stronger, then watch for his knee, he’s gonna go for your vitals. And that’s what that</p>
      <p>old buzzard is doing, going for your vitals.”</p>
      <p>Harding’s face  is still colorless, but he’s got control of his hands again; they flip loosely before</p>
      <p>him, trying to toss off what McMurphy has been saying:</p>
      <p>“Our  dear  Miss  Ratched?  Our  sweet,  smiling,  tender  angel  of  mercy,  Mother  Ratched,  a  ball-</p>
      <p>cutter? Why, friend, that’s most unlikely.”</p>
      <p>“Buddy,  don’t  give  me  that  tender  little  mother  crap.  She  may  be  a  mother, but  she’s  big  as  a</p>
      <p>damn barn and tough as knife metal. She fooled me with that kindly little old mother bit for maybe</p>
      <p>three minutes when I came in this morning, but no longer. I don’t think she’s really fooled any of</p>
      <p>you guys for any six months or a year, neither. Hooowee, I’ve seen some bitches in my time, but she</p>
      <p>takes the cake.”</p>
      <p>“A  bitch?  But  a  moment  ago  she  was  a  ball-cutter,  then  a  [58]  buzzard—or  was  it  a  chicken?</p>
      <p>Your metaphors are bumping into each other, my friend.”</p>
      <p>“The hell with that; she’s a bitch and a buzzard and a ball-cutter, and don’t kid me, you know</p>
      <p>what I’m talking about.”</p>
      <p>Harding’s  face  and  hands  are  moving  faster  than  ever  now,  a  speeded  film  of  gestures,  grins,</p>
      <p>grimaces,  sneers.  The  more  he  tries  to  stop  it, the faster  it  goes.  When he  lets  his  hands  and  face</p>
      <p>move like they want to and doesn’t try to hold them back, they flow and gesture in a way that’s real</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>36</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>pretty to watch, but when he worries about them and tries to hold back he becomes a wild, jerky</p>
      <p>puppet doing a high-strung dance. Everything is moving faster and faster, and his voice is speeding</p>
      <p>up to match.</p>
      <p>“Why,  see  here,  my  friend  Mr.  McMurphy,  my  psychopathic  sidekick,  our  Miss  Ratched  is  a</p>
      <p>veritable angel of mercy and why just everyone knows it. She’s unselfish as the wind, toiling thanklessly</p>
      <p>for the good of all, day after day, five long days a week. That takes heart, my friend, heart. In fact, I</p>
      <p>have  been  informed  by  sources—I  am  not  at  liberty  to  disclose  my  sources,  but  I  might  say  that</p>
      <p>Martini  is  in  contact  with  the  same  people  a  good  part  of  the  time—that  she  even  further  serves</p>
      <p>mankind on her weekends off by doing generous volunteer work about town. Preparing a rich array</p>
      <p>of  charity—canned  goods,  cheese  for  the  binding  effect,  soap—and  presenting  it  to  some  poor</p>
      <p>young couple having a difficult time financially.” His hands flash in the air, molding the picture he is</p>
      <p>describing. “Ah, look: There she is, our nurse. Her gentle knock on the door. The ribboned basket.</p>
      <p>The young couple overjoyed to the point of speechlessness. The husband open-mouthed, the wife</p>
      <p>weeping openly. She appraises their dwelling. Promises to send them money for—scouring powder,</p>
      <p>yes. She places the basket in the center of the floor. And when our angel leaves—throwing kisses,</p>
      <p>smiling  ethereally—she  is  so  intoxicated  with  the  sweet  milk  of  human  kindness  that  her  deed  has</p>
      <p>generated within her large bosom, that she is beside herself with generosity. Be-side herself, do you</p>
      <p>hear? Pausing at the door, she draws the timid young bride to one side and offers her twenty dollars</p>
      <p>of her own: ‘Go, you poor unfortunate underfed child, go, and buy yourself a decent dress. I realize</p>
      <p>your husband can’t afford it, but here, take this, and go.’ And the couple is forever indebted to her</p>
      <p>benevolence.”</p>
      <p>He’s been talking faster and faster, the cords stretching out in his neck. When he stops talking,</p>
      <p>the ward is completely silent. I don’t hear anything but a faint reeling rhythm, what I figure is a tape</p>
      <p>recorder somewhere getting all of this.</p>
      <p>[59]  Harding  looks  around,  sees  everybody’s  watching  him,  and  he  does  his  best  to  laugh.  A</p>
      <p>sound comes out of his mouth like a nail being crowbarred out of a plank of green pine; Eee-eee-</p>
      <p>eee. He can’t stop it. He wrings his hands like a fly and clinches his eyes at the awful sound of that</p>
      <p>squeaking. But he can’t stop it. It gets higher and higher until finally, with a suck of breath, he lets</p>
      <p>his face fall into his waiting hands.</p>
      <p>“Oh the bitch, the bitch, the bitch,” he whispers through his teeth.</p>
      <p>McMurphy  lights  another  cigarette  and  offers  it  to  him;  Harding  takes  it  without  a  word.</p>
      <p>McMurphy  is  still  watching  Harding’s  face  in  front  of  him  there,  with  a  kind  of  puzzled  wonder,</p>
      <p>looking at it like it’s the first human face he ever laid eyes on. He watches while Harding’s twitching</p>
      <p>and jerking slows down and the face comes up from the hands.</p>
      <p>“You  are  right,”  Harding  says,  “about  all  of  it.”  He  looks  up  at  the  other  patients  who  are</p>
      <p>watching him. “No one’s ever dared come out and say it before, but there’s not a man among us</p>
      <p>that  doesn’t  think  it,  that  doesn’t  feel  just  as  you  do  about  her  and  the  whole  business—feel  it</p>
      <p>somewhere down deep in his scared little soul.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy frowns and asks, “What about that little fart of a doctor? He might be a little slow in</p>
      <p>the head, but not so much as not to be able to see how she’s taken over and what she’s doing.”</p>
      <p>Harding  takes  a  long  pull  off  the  cigarette  and  lets  the  smoke  drift  out  with  his  talk.  “Doctor</p>
      <p>Spivey … is exactly like the rest of us, McMurphy, completely conscious of his inadequacy. He’s a</p>
      <p>frightened, desperate, ineffectual little rabbit, totally incapable of running this ward without our Miss</p>
      <p>Ratched’s help, and he knows it. And, worse, she knows he knows it and reminds him every chance</p>
      <p>she gets. Every time she finds he’s made a little slip in the bookwork or in, say, the charting you can</p>
      <p>just imagine her in there grinding his nose in it.”</p>
      <p>“That’s right,” Cheswick says, coming up beside McMurphy, “grinds our noses in our mistakes.”</p>
      <p>“Why don’t he fire her?”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>37</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“In  this  hospital,”  Harding  says,  “the  doctor  doesn’t  hold  the  power  of  hiring  and  firing.  That</p>
      <p>power goes to the supervisor, and the supervisor is a woman, a dear old friend of Miss Ratched’s;</p>
      <p>they were Army nurses together in the thirties. We are victims of a matriarchy here, my friend, and</p>
      <p>the doctor is just as helpless against it as we are. He knows that all Ratched has to do is pick up that</p>
      <p>phone you see sitting [60] at her elbow and call the supervisor and mention, oh, say, that the doctor</p>
      <p>seems to be making a great number of requisitions for Demerol—”</p>
      <p>“Hold it, Harding, I’m not up on all this shop talk.”</p>
      <p>“Demerol,  my  friend,  is  a  synthetic  opiate,  twice  as  addictive  as  heroin.  Quite  common  for</p>
      <p>doctors to be addicted to it.”</p>
      <p>“That little fart? Is he a dope addict?”</p>
      <p>“I’m certain I don’t know.”</p>
      <p>“Then where does she get off with accusing him of—”</p>
      <p>“Oh,  you’re  not  paying  attention,  my  friend.  She  doesn’t  accuse.  She  merely  needs  to  insinuate,</p>
      <p>insinuate  anything,  don’t  you  see?  Didn’t  you  notice  today?  She’ll  call  a  man  to  the  door  of  the</p>
      <p>Nurses’ Station and stand there and ask him about a Kleenex found under his bed. No more, just</p>
      <p>ask. And he’ll feel like he’s lying to her, whatever answer he gives. If he says he was cleaning a pen</p>
      <p>with it, she’ll say, ‘I see, a pen,’ or if he says he has a cold in his nose, she’ll say, ‘I see, a cold,’ and</p>
      <p>she’ll nod her neat little gray coiffure and smile her neat little smile and turn and go back into the</p>
      <p>Nurses’ Station, leave him standing there wondering just what did he use that Kleenex for.”</p>
      <p>He starts to tremble again, and his shoulders fold back around him.</p>
      <p>“No. She doesn’t need to accuse. She has a genius for insinuation. Did you ever hear her, in the</p>
      <p>course of our discussion today, ever once hear her accuse me of anything? Yet it seems I have been</p>
      <p>accused of a multitude of things, of jealousy and paranoia, of not being man enough to satisfy my</p>
      <p>wife, of having relations with male friends of mine, of holding my cigarette in an affected manner,</p>
      <p>even—it  seems  to  me—accused  of  having  nothing  between  my  legs  but  a  patch of  hair—and soft</p>
      <p>and downy and blond hair at that! Ball-cutter? Oh, you underestimate her!”</p>
      <p>Harding hushes all of a sudden and leans forward to take McMurphy’s hand in both of his. His</p>
      <p>face is tilted oddly, edged, jagged purple and gray, a busted wine bottle.</p>
      <p>“This world ... belongs to the strong, my friend! The ritual of our existence is based on the strong</p>
      <p>getting stronger by devouring the weak. We must face up to this. No more than right that it should</p>
      <p>be this way. We must learn to accept it as a law of the natural world. The rabbits accept their role in</p>
      <p>the ritual and recognize the wolf as the strong. In defense, the rabbit becomes sly and frightened and</p>
      <p>elusive and he digs holes and hides when the wolf is about. And he endures, he goes on. He knows</p>
      <p>his place. He most certainly doesn’t [61] challenge  the wolf to combat. Now, would that be wise?</p>
      <p>Would it?”</p>
      <p>He lets go McMurphy’s hand and leans back and crosses his legs, takes another long pull off the</p>
      <p>cigarette. He pulls the cigarette from his thin crack of a smile, and the laugh starts up again—eee-</p>
      <p>eee-eee, like a nail coming out of a plank.</p>
      <p>“Mr. McMurphy ... my friend ... I’m not a chicken, I’m a rabbit. The doctor is a rabbit. Cheswick</p>
      <p>there  is  a  rabbit.  Billy  Bibbit  is  a  rabbit.  All  of  us  in  here  are  rabbits  of  varying  ages  and  degrees,</p>
      <p>hippity-hopping  through  our  Walt  Disney  world.  Oh,  don’t  misunderstand  me,  we’re  not  in  here</p>
      <p>because we are rabbits—we’d be rabbits wherever we were—we’re all in here because we can’t adjust</p>
      <p>to our rabbithood. We need a good strong wolf like the nurse to teach us our place.”</p>
      <p>“Man, you’re talkin’ like a fool. You mean to tell me that you’re gonna sit back and let some old</p>
      <p>blue-haired woman talk you into being a rabbit?”</p>
      <p>“Not talk me into it, no. I was born a rabbit. Just look at me. I simply need the nurse to make me</p>
      <p>happy with my role.”</p>
      <p>“You’re no damned rabbit!”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>38</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“See the ears? the wiggly nose? the cute little button tail?”</p>
      <p>“You’re talking like a crazy ma—”</p>
      <p>“Like a crazy man? How astute.”</p>
      <p>“Damn  it,  Harding,  I  didn’t  mean  it  like  that.  You  ain’t  crazy  that  way.  I  mean—hell,  I  been</p>
      <p>surprised  how  sane  you  guys  all  are.  As  near  as  I  can  tell  you’re  not  any  crazier  than  the  average</p>
      <p>asshole on the street—”</p>
      <p>“Ah yes, the asshole on the street.”</p>
      <p>“But  not,  you  know,  crazy  like  the  movies  paint  crazy  people.  You’re  just  hung  up  and—kind</p>
      <p>of—”</p>
      <p>“Kind of rabbit-like, isn’t that it?”</p>
      <p>“Rabbits, hell! Not a thing like rabbits, goddammit.”</p>
      <p>“Mr. Bibbit, hop around for Mr. McMurphy here. Mr. Cheswick, show him how furry, you are.”</p>
      <p>Billy Bibbit and Cheswick change into hunched-over white rabbits, right before my eyes, but they</p>
      <p>are too ashamed to do any of the things Harding told them to do.</p>
      <p>“Ah, they’re bashful, McMurphy. Isn’t that sweet? Or, perhaps, the fellows are ill at ease because</p>
      <p>they didn’t stick up for their friend. Perhaps they are feeling guilty for the way they once again let</p>
      <p>her victimize them into being her interrogators. Cheer up, friends, you’ve no reason to feel ashamed.</p>
      <p>It is all as it should be. It’s not the rabbit’s place to stick up for his fellow. That would have been</p>
      <p>foolish. No, you were wise, cowardly but wise.”</p>
      <p>[62] “Look here, Harding,” Cheswick says.</p>
      <p>“No, no, Cheswick. Don’t get irate at the truth.”</p>
      <p>“Now look here; there’s been times when I’ve said the same things about old lady Ratched that</p>
      <p>McMurphy has been saying.”</p>
      <p>“Yes, but you said them very quietly and took them all back later. You are a rabbit too, don’t try</p>
      <p>to avoid the truth. That’s why I hold no grudge against you for the questions you asked me during</p>
      <p>the meeting today. You were only playing your role. If you had been on the carpet, or you Billy, or</p>
      <p>you  Fredrickson,  I  would  have  attacked  you  just  as  cruelly  as  you  attacked  me.  We  mustn’t  be</p>
      <p>ashamed of our behavior; it’s the way we little animals were meant to behave.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy turns in his chair and looks the other Acutes up and down. “I ain’t so sure but what</p>
      <p>they should be ashamed. Personally, I thought it was damned crummy the way they swung in on her</p>
      <p>side against you. For a minute there I thought I was back in a Red Chinese prison camp ...”</p>
      <p>“Now by God, McMurphy,” Cheswick says, “you listen here.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy turns and listens, but Cheswick doesn’t go on. Cheswick never goes on; he’s one of</p>
      <p>these guys who’ll make a big fuss like he’s going to lead an attack, holler charge and stomp up and</p>
      <p>down a minute, take a couple steps, and quit. McMurphy looks at him where he’s been caught off</p>
      <p>base again after such a tough-sounding start, and says to him, “A hell of a lot like a Chinese prison</p>
      <p>camp.”</p>
      <p>Harding holds up his hands for peace. “Oh, no, no, that isn’t right. You mustn’t condemn us, my</p>
      <p>friend. No. In fact …”</p>
      <p>I see that sly fever come into Harding’s eye again; I think he’s going to start laughing, but instead</p>
      <p>he takes his cigarette out of his mouth and points it at McMurphy—in his hand it looks like one of</p>
      <p>his thin, white fingers, smoking at the end.</p>
      <p>“… you too, Mr. McMurphy, for all your cowboy bluster and your sideshow swagger, you too,</p>
      <p>under that crusty surface, are probably just as soft and fuzzy and rabbit-souled as we are.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah,  you  bet.  I’m  a  little  cottontail.  Just  what  is  it  makes  me  a  rabbit,  Harding?  My</p>
      <p>psychopathic tendencies? Is it my fightin’ tendencies, or my fuckin’ tendencies? Must be the fuckin’,</p>
      <p>mustn’t it? All that whambam-thank-you-ma’am. Yeah, that whambam, that’s probably what makes</p>
      <p>me a rabbit—”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>39</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Wait; I’m afraid you’ve raised a point that requires some deliberation. Rabbits are noted for that</p>
      <p>certain trait, aren’t they? Notorious, in fact, for their whambam. Yes. Um. But [63] in any case, the.</p>
      <p>point you bring up simply indicates that you are a healthy, functioning and adequate rabbit, whereas</p>
      <p>most of us in here even lack the sexual ability to make the grade as adequate rabbits. Failures, we</p>
      <p>are—feeble,  stunted,  weak  little  creatures  in  a  weak  little  race.  Rabbits,  sans  whambam;  a  pathetic</p>
      <p>notion.”</p>
      <p>“Wait a minute; you keep twistin’ what I say—”</p>
      <p>“No. You were right. You remember, it was you that drew our attention to the place where the</p>
      <p>nurse was concentrating her pecking? That was true. There’s not a man here that isn’t afraid he is</p>
      <p>losing or has already lost his whambam. We comical little creatures can’t even achieve masculinity in</p>
      <p>the rabbit world, that’s how weak and inadequate we are. Hee. We are—the rabbits, one might say, of</p>
      <p>the rabbit world!”</p>
      <p>He leans forward again, and that strained, squeaking laugh of his that I been expecting begins to</p>
      <p>rise from his mouth, his hands flipping around, his lace twitching.</p>
      <p>“Harding! Shut your damned mouth!”</p>
      <p>It’s like a slap. Harding is hushed, chopped off cold with his mouth still open in a drawn grin, his</p>
      <p>hands dangling in a cloud of blue tobacco smoke. He freezes this way a second; then his eyes narrow</p>
      <p>into sly little holes and he lets them slip over to McMurphy, speaks so soft that I have to push my</p>
      <p>broom up right next to his chair to hear what he says.</p>
      <p>“Friend ... you ... may be a wolf.”</p>
      <p>“Goddammit, I’m no wolf and you’re no rabbit. Hoo, I never heard such—”</p>
      <p>“You have a very wolfy roar.”</p>
      <p>With a loud hissing o: breath McMurphy turns from Harding to the rest of the Acutes standing</p>
      <p>around.  “Here;  all  you  guys.  What  the  hell  is  the  matter  with  you?  You  ain’t  as  crazy  as  all  this,</p>
      <p>thinking you’re some animal.”</p>
      <p>“No,” Cheswick says and steps in beside McMurphy. “No, by God, not me. I’m not any rabbit.”</p>
      <p>“That’s  the  boy,  Cheswick.  And  the  rest  of  you,  let’s  just  knock  it  off.  Look  at  you,  talking</p>
      <p>yourself  into  running  scared  from  some  fifty-year-old  woman.  What  is  there  she  can  do  to  you,</p>
      <p>anyway?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, what?” Cheswick says and glares around at the others.</p>
      <p>“She can’t have you whipped. She can’t burn you with hot irons. She can’t tie you to the rack.</p>
      <p>They got laws about that sort of thing nowadays; this ain’t the Middle Ages. There’s not a thing in</p>
      <p>the world that she can—”</p>
      <p>“You  s-s-saw  what  she  c-can  do  to  us!  In  the  m-m-meeting  [64]  today.”  I  see  Billy  Bibbit  has</p>
      <p>changed back from a rabbit. He leans toward McMurphy, trying to go on, his mouth wet with spit</p>
      <p>and his face red. Then he turns and walks away. “Ah, it’s n-no use. I should just k-k-kill myself.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy calls after him. “Today? What did I see in the meeting today? Hell’s bells,  all I saw</p>
      <p>today  was  her  asking  a  couple  of  questions,  and  nice,  easy  questions  at  that.  Questions  ain’t</p>
      <p>bonebreakers, they ain’t sticks and stones.”</p>
      <p>Billy turns back. “But the wuh-wuh-way she asks them—”</p>
      <p>“You don’t have to answer, do you?”</p>
      <p>“If you d-don’t answer she just smiles and m-m-makes a note in her little book and then she—</p>
      <p>she—oh, hell!”</p>
      <p>Scanlon  comes  up  beside  Billy.  “If  you  don’t  answer  her  questions,  Mack,  you  admit  it  just  by</p>
      <p>keeping  quiet.  It’s  the  way  those bastards  in  the  government  get  you.  You  can’t  beat  it.  The  only</p>
      <p>thing to do is blow the whole business off the face of the whole bleeding earth—blow it all up.”</p>
      <p>“Well, when she asks one of those questions, why don’t you tell her to up and go to hell?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah,” Cheswick says, shaking his fist, “tell her to up and go to hell.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>40</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“So then what, Mack? She’d just come right back with ‘Why do you seem so upset by that par-tik-</p>
      <p>uler question, Patient McMurphy?’ ”</p>
      <p>“So, you tell her to go to hell again. Tell them all to go to hell. They still haven’t hurt you.”</p>
      <p>The Acutes are crowding closer around him. Fredrickson answers this time. “Okay, you tell her</p>
      <p>that  and you’re  listed  as  Potential  Assaultive  and  shipped  upstairs  to  the Disturbed  ward.  I had  it</p>
      <p>happen. Three times. Those poor goofs up there don’t even get off the ward to go to the Saturday</p>
      <p>afternoon movie. They don’t even have a TV.”</p>
      <p>“And, my friend, if you continue to demonstrate such hostile tendencies, such as telling people to</p>
      <p>go to hell, you get lined up to go to the Shock Shop, perhaps even on to greater things, an operation,</p>
      <p>an—”</p>
      <p>“Damn it, Harding, I told you I’m not up on this talk.”</p>
      <p>“The Shock Shop, Mr. McMurphy, is jargon for the EST machine, the Electro Shock Therapy. A</p>
      <p>device that might be said to do the work of the sleeping pill, the electric chair, and the torture rack.</p>
      <p>It’s a clever little procedure, simple, quick, nearly painless it happens so fast, but no one ever wants</p>
      <p>another one. Ever.”</p>
      <p>“What’s this thing do?”</p>
      <p>“You are strapped to a table, shaped, ironically, like a cross, [65] with a crown of electric sparks in</p>
      <p>place  of  thorns.  You  are  touched  on  each  side  of  the  head  with  wires.  Zap!  Five  cents’  worth of</p>
      <p>electricity  through  the  brain  and  you  are  jointly  administered  therapy  and  a  punishment  for  your</p>
      <p>hostile go-to-hell behavior, on top of being put out of everyone’s way for six hours to three days,</p>
      <p>depending  on  the  individual.  Even  when  you  do  regain  consciousness  you  are  in  a  state  of</p>
      <p>disorientation for days. You are unable to think coherently. You can’t recall things. Enough of these</p>
      <p>treatments and a man could turn out like Mr. Ellis you see over there against the wall. A drooling,</p>
      <p>pants-wetting idiot at thirty-five. Or turn into a mindless organism that eats and eliminates and yells</p>
      <p>‘fuck the wife,’ like Ruckly. Or look at Chief Broom clutching to his namesake there beside you.”</p>
      <p>Harding points his cigarette at me, too late for me to back off. I make like I don’t notice. Go on</p>
      <p>with my sweeping.</p>
      <p>“I’ve  heard  that  the  Chief,  years  ago,  received  more  than two hundred  shock  treatments  when</p>
      <p>they were really the vogue. Imagine what this could do to a mind that was already slipping. Look at</p>
      <p>him: a giant janitor. There’s your Vanishing American, a six-foot-eight sweeping machine, scared of</p>
      <p>its own shadow. That, my friend, is what we can be threatened with.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy  looks  at  me  a  while,  then  turns  back  to  Harding.  “Man,  I  tell  you,  how  come  you</p>
      <p>stand  for  it?  What  about  this  democratic-ward  manure  that the  doctor  was  giving  me?  Why  don’t</p>
      <p>you take a vote?”</p>
      <p>Harding smiles at him and takes another slow drag on his cigarette. “Vote what, my friend? Vote</p>
      <p>that the nurse may not ask any more questions in Group Meeting? Vote that she shall not look at us</p>
      <p>in a certain way? You tell me, Mr. McMurphy, what do we vote on?”</p>
      <p>“Hell, I don’t care. Vote on anything. Don’t you see you have to do something to show you still</p>
      <p>got some guts? Don’t you see you can’t let her take over completely? Look at you here: you say the</p>
      <p>Chief  is  scared of  his own  shadow,  but  I  never  saw  a  scareder-looking  bunch  in  my  life  than  you</p>
      <p>guys.”</p>
      <p>“Not me!” Cheswick says.</p>
      <p>“Maybe not you, buddy, but the rest are even scared to open up and laugh. You know, that’s the</p>
      <p>first thing that got me about this place, that there wasn’t anybody laughing. I haven’t heard a real</p>
      <p>laugh since I came through that door, do you know that? Man, when you lose your laugh you lose</p>
      <p>your footing. A man go around lettin’ a woman whup him down till he can’t laugh any more, and he</p>
      <p>loses  one of  the  biggest  edges  he’s  [66]  got  on  his  side.  First  thing  you  know  he’ll  begin  to think</p>
      <p>she’s tougher than he is and—”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>41</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Ah. I believe my friend is catching on, fellow rabbits. Tell me, Mr. McMurphy, bow does one go</p>
      <p>about  showing  a  woman  who’s  boss,  I  mean  other  than  laughing  at  her?  How  does  he  show  her</p>
      <p>who’s  king  of  the  mountain?  A  man  like  you  should  be  able  to  tell  us  that.  You  don’t  slap  her</p>
      <p>around, do you? No, then she calls the law. You don’t lose your temper and shout at her; she’ll win</p>
      <p>by trying to placate her big ol’ angry boy: ‘Is us wittle man getting fussy? Ahhhhh?’ Have you ever</p>
      <p>tried to keep up a noble and angry front in the face of such consolation? So you see, my friend, it is</p>
      <p>somewhat as you stated: man has but one truly effective weapon against the juggernaut of modern</p>
      <p>matriarchy,  but  it  certainly  is  not  laughter.  One  weapon,  and  with  every  passing  year  in  this  hip,</p>
      <p>motivationally researched society, more and more people are discovering how to render that weapon</p>
      <p>useless and conquer those who have hitherto been the conquerors—”</p>
      <p>“Lord, Harding, but you do come on,” McMurphy says.</p>
      <p>“—and do you think, for all your acclaimed psychopathic powers, that you could effectively use</p>
      <p>your  weapon  against  our  champion?  Do  you  think  you  could  use  it  against  Miss  Ratched,</p>
      <p>McMurphy? Ever?”</p>
      <p>And  sweeps  one  of  his  hands  toward  the  glass  case.  Everybody’s  head  turns  to  look.  She’s  in</p>
      <p>there, looking out through her window, got a tape recorder hid out of sight somewhere, getting all</p>
      <p>this down—already planning how to work it into the schedule.</p>
      <p>The nurse sees everybody looking at her and she nods and they all turn away. McMurphy takes</p>
      <p>off his cap and runs his hands into that red hair. Now everybody is looking at him; they’re waiting</p>
      <p>for him to make an answer and he knows it. He feels he’s been trapped some way. He puts the cap</p>
      <p>back on and rubs the stitch marks on his nose.</p>
      <p>“Why, if you mean do I think I could get a bone up over that old buzzard, no, I don’t believe I</p>
      <p>could. ...”</p>
      <p>“She’s not all that homely, McMurphy. Her face is quite handsome and well preserved. And in</p>
      <p>spite of all her attempts to conceal them, in that sexless get-up, you can still make out the evidence of</p>
      <p>some rather extraordinary breasts. She must have been a rather beautiful young woman. Still—for</p>
      <p>the sake of argument, could you get it up over her even if she wasn’t old, even if she was young and</p>
      <p>had the beauty of Helen?”</p>
      <p>“I don’t know Helen, but I see what you’re drivin’ at. And [67] you’re by God right. I couldn’t get</p>
      <p>it up over old frozen face in there even if she had the beauty of Marilyn Monroe.”</p>
      <p>“There you are. She’s won.”</p>
      <p>That’s  it.  Harding  leans  back  and  everybody  waits  for  what  McMurphy’s  going  to  say  next.</p>
      <p>McMurphy can see he’s backed up against the wall. He looks at the faces a minute, then shrugs and</p>
      <p>stands up from his chair.</p>
      <p>“Well, what the hell, it’s no skin off my nose.”</p>
      <p>“That’s true, it’s no skin off your nose.”</p>
      <p>“And I damn well don’t want to have some old fiend of a nurse after me with three thousand</p>
      <p>volts. Not when there’s nothing in it for me but the adventure.”</p>
      <p>“No. You’re right.”</p>
      <p>Harding’s won the argument, but nobody looks too happy. McMurphy hooks his thumbs in his</p>
      <p>pockets and tries a laugh.</p>
      <p>“No sir, I never heard of anybody offering a twenty-bone bounty for bagging a ball-cutter.”</p>
      <p>Everybody grins at this with him, but they’re not happy. I’m glad McMurphy is going to be cagey</p>
      <p>after all and not get sucked in on something he can’t whip, but I know how the guys feel; I’m not so</p>
      <p>happy  myself.  McMurphy  lights  another  cigarette.  Nobody’s  moved  yet.  They’re  all  still  standing</p>
      <p>there, grinning and uncomfortable. McMurphy rubs his nose again and looks away from the bunch</p>
      <p>of faces hung out there around him, looks back at the nurse and chews his lip.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>42</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“But you say ... she don’t send you up to that other ward unless she gets your goat? Unless she</p>
      <p>makes you crack in some way and you end up cussing her out or busting a window or something like</p>
      <p>that?”</p>
      <p>“Unless you do something like that.”</p>
      <p>“You’re sure of that, now? Because I’m getting just the shadiest notion of how to pick up a good</p>
      <p>purse off you birds in here. But I don’t want to be a sucker about it. I had a hell of a time getting</p>
      <p>outa that other hole; I don’t want to be jumping outa the fryin’ pan into the fire.”</p>
      <p>“Absolutely certain. She’s powerless unless you do something to honestly deserve the Disturbed</p>
      <p>Ward or EST. If you’re tough enough to keep her from getting to you, she can’t do a thing.”</p>
      <p>“So if I behave myself and don’t cuss her out—”</p>
      <p>“Or cuss one of the aides out.”</p>
      <p>“—or cuss one of the aides out or tear up jack some way around here, she can’t do nothing to</p>
      <p>me?”</p>
      <p>“Those are the rules we play by. Of course, she always wins, my friend, always. She’s impregnable</p>
      <p>herself, and with the [68] element of time working for her she eventually gets inside everyone. That’s</p>
      <p>why  the  hospital  regards  her  as  its  top  nurse  and  grants  her  so  much  authority;  she’s  a  master  at</p>
      <p>forcing the trembling libido out into the open—”</p>
      <p>“The hell with that. What I want to know is am I safe to try to beat her at her own game? If I</p>
      <p>come  on  nice  as  pie  to  her,  whatever  else  I  in-sinuate,  she  ain’t  gonna  get  in  a  tizzy  and  have  me</p>
      <p>electrocuted?”</p>
      <p>“You’re  safe  as  long  as  you  keep  control.  As  long  as  you  don’t  lose  your  temper  and  give  her</p>
      <p>actual reason to request the restriction of the Disturbed Ward, or the therapeutic benefits of Electro</p>
      <p>Shock, you are safe. But that entails first and foremost keeping one’s temper. And you? With your</p>
      <p>red hair and black record? Why delude yourself?”</p>
      <p>“Okay. All right.” McMurphy rubs his palms together. “Here’s what I’m thinkin’. You birds seem</p>
      <p>to  think  you  got  quite  the  champ  in  there,  don’t  you?  Quite  the—what  did  you  call  her?—sure,</p>
      <p>impregnable woman. What I want to know is how many of you are dead sure enough to put a little</p>
      <p>money on her?”</p>
      <p>“Dead sure enough ...?”</p>
      <p>“Just what I said: any of you sharpies here willing to take my five bucks that says that I can get</p>
      <p>the best of that woman—before the week’s up—without her getting the best of me? One week, and</p>
      <p>if I don’t have her to where she don’t know whether to shit or go blind, the bet is yours.”</p>
      <p>“You’re betting on this?” Cheswick is hopping from foot to foot and rubbing his hands together</p>
      <p>like McMurphy rubs his. “You’re damned right.”</p>
      <p>Harding and some of the others say that they don’t get it.</p>
      <p>“It’s simple enough. There ain’t nothing noble or complicated about it. I like to gamble. And I</p>
      <p>like to win. And I think I can win this gamble, okay? It got so at Pendleton the guys wouldn’t even</p>
      <p>lag pennies with me on account of I was such a winner. Why, one of the big reasons I got myself</p>
      <p>sent here was because I needed some new suckers. I’ll tell you something: I found out a few things</p>
      <p>about  this  place  before  I  came  out  here.  Damn  near  half  of  you  guys  in  here  pull  compensation,</p>
      <p>three, four hundred a month and not a thing in the world to do with it but let it draw dust. I thought</p>
      <p>I might take advantage of this and maybe make both our lives a little more richer. I’m starting level</p>
      <p>with you. I’m a gambler and I’m not in the habit of losing. And I’ve never seen a woman I thought</p>
      <p>was more man than me, I don’t care whether I can get it up [69] for her or not. She may have the</p>
      <p>element of time, but I got a pretty long winning streak goin’ myself.”</p>
      <p>He pulls off his cap, spins it on his finger, and catches it behind his back in his other band, neat</p>
      <p>as you please.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>43</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Another thing: I’m in this place because that’s the way I planned it, pure and simple, because it’s</p>
      <p>a better place than a work farm. As near as I can tell I’m no loony, or never knew it if I was. Your</p>
      <p>nurse don’t know this; she’s not going to be looking out for somebody coming at her with a trigger-</p>
      <p>quick mind like I obviously got. These things give me an edge I like. So I’m saying five bucks to each</p>
      <p>of you that wants it if I can’t put a betsy bug up that nurse’s butt within a week.”</p>
      <p>“I’m still not sure I—”</p>
      <p>“Just that. A bee in her butt, a burr in her bloomers. Get her goat. Bug her till she comes apart at</p>
      <p>those neat little seams, and shows, just one time, she ain’t so unbeatable as you think. One week. I’ll</p>
      <p>let you be the judge whether I win or not.”</p>
      <p>Harding takes out a pencil and writes something on the pinochle pad.</p>
      <p>“Here.  A  lien  on  ten  dollars  of  that  money  they’ve  got  drawing  dust  under  my  name  over  in</p>
      <p>Funds. It’s worth twice that to me, my friend, to see this unlikely miracle brought off.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy  looks  at  the  paper  and  folds  it.  “Worth  it  to  any  of  the  rest  of  you  birds?”  Other</p>
      <p>Acutes  line  up  now,  taking  turns  at  the  pad.  He  takes  the  pieces  of  paper  when  they’re  finished,</p>
      <p>stacking them on his palm, pinned under a big stiff thumb. I see the pieces of paper crowd up in his</p>
      <p>hand. He looks them over.</p>
      <p>“You trust me to hold the bets, buddies?”</p>
      <p>“I  believe  we  can  be  safe  in  doing  that,”  Harding  says.  “You  won’t  be  going  any  place  for  a</p>
      <p>while.”</p>

      <p>One  Christmas  at  midnight  on  the  button,  at  the  old  place,  the  ward  door  blows  open  with  a</p>
      <p>crash, in comes a fat man with a beard, eyes ringed red by the cold and his nose just the color of a</p>
      <p>cherry. The black boys get him cornered in the hall with flashlights. I see he’s all tangled in the tinsel</p>
      <p>Public  Relation  has  been  stringing  all  over  the  place,  and  he’s  stumbling  around  in  it  in  the  dark.</p>
      <p>He’s shading his red eyes from the flashlights and sucking on his mustache.</p>
      <p>“Ho ho ho,” he says. “I’d like to stay but I must be hurrying along. Very tight schedule, ya know.</p>
      <p>Ho ho. Must be going ...”</p>
      <p>The  black  boys  move  in  with  the  flashlights.  They  kept  him  with  us  six  years  before  they</p>
      <p>discharged him, clean-shaven and skinny as a pole.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>The Big Nurse is able to set the wall clock at whatever speed she wants by just turning one of</p>
      <p>those dials in the steel door; she takes a notion to hurry things up, she turns the speed up, and those</p>
      <p>hands whip around that disk like spokes in a wheel. The scene in the picture-screen windows goes</p>
      <p>through rapid changes of light to show morning, noon, and night—throb off and on furiously with</p>
      <p>day  and  dark,  and  everybody  is  driven  like  mad  to  keep  up  with  that  passing  of  fake  time;  awful</p>
      <p>scramble of shaves and breakfasts and appointments and lunches and medications and ten minutes</p>
      <p>of night so you barely get your eyes closed before the dorm light’s screaming at you to get up and</p>
      <p>start  the  scramble  again,  go  like  a  sonofabitch  this  way,  going  through  the  full  schedule  of  a  day</p>
      <p>maybe twenty times an hour, till the Big Nurse sees everybody is right up to the breaking point, and</p>
      <p>she slacks off on the throttle, eases off the pace on that clock-dial, like some kid been fooling with</p>
      <p>the moving-picture projection  machine  and  finally  got  tired  watching  the  film  run  at ten times  its</p>
      <p>natural speed, got bored with all that silly scampering and insect squeak of talk and turned it back to</p>
      <p>normal.</p>
      <p>She’s given to turning up the speed this way on days like, [71] say, when you got somebody to</p>
      <p>visit you or when the VFW brings down a smoker show from Portland—times like that, times you’d</p>
      <p>like to hold and have stretch out. That’s when she speeds things up.</p>
      <p>But generally it’s the other way, the slow way. She’ll turn that dial to a dead stop and freeze the</p>
      <p>sun there on the screen so it don’t move a scant hair for weeks, so not a leaf on a tree or a blade of</p>
      <p>grass in the pasture shimmers. The clock hands hang at two minutes to three and she’s liable to let</p>
      <p>them hang there till we rust. You sit solid and you can’t budge, you can’t walk or move to relieve the</p>
      <p>strain of sitting, you can’t swallow and you can’t breathe. The only thing you can move is your eyes</p>
      <p>and there’s nothing to see but petrified Acutes across the room waiting on one another to decide</p>
      <p>whose play it is. The old Chronic next to me has been dead six days, and he’s rotting to the chair.</p>
      <p>And  instead  of  fog  sometimes  she’ll  let  a  clear  chemical  gas  in  through  the  vents,  and  the  whole</p>
      <p>ward is set solid when the gas changes into plastic.</p>
      <p>Lord knows how long we hang this way.</p>
      <p>Then, gradually, she’ll ease the dial up a degree, and that’s worse yet. I can take hanging dead still</p>
      <p>better’n I can take that sirup-slow hand of Scanlon across the room, taking three days to lay down a</p>
      <p>card. My lungs pull for the thick plastic air like getting it through a pinhole. I try to go to the latrine</p>
      <p>and I feel buried under a ton of sand, squeezing my bladder till green sparks flash and buzz across</p>
      <p>my forehead.</p>
      <p>I strain with every muscle and bone to get out of that chair and go to the latrine, work to get up</p>
      <p>till  my  arms  and  legs  are  all  ashake  and  my  teeth  hurt.  I  pull  and  pull  and  all  I  gain  is  maybe  a</p>
      <p>quarter-inch off the leather seat. So I fall back and give up and let the pee pour out, activating a hot</p>
      <p>salt  wire  down  my  left  leg  that  sets  off humiliating  alarms,  sirens,  spotlights,  everybody  up  yelling</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>45</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>and running around and the big black boys knocking the crowd aside right and left as the both of</p>
      <p>them  rush  headlong  at  me,  waving  awful  mops  of  wet  copper  wires  cracking  and  spitting  as  they</p>
      <p>short with the water.</p>
      <p>About  the  only  time  we  get  any  let-up  from  this  time  control  is  in  the  fog;  then  time  doesn’t</p>
      <p>mean  anything.  It’s  lost  in  the  fog,  like  everything  else.  (They  haven’t  really  fogged  the  place  full</p>
      <p>force all day today, not since McMurphy came in. I bet he’d yell like a bull if they fogged it.)</p>
      <p>When nothing else is going on, you usually got the fog or the time control to contend with, but</p>
      <p>today  something’s  happened: there hasn’t  been  any  of these  things  worked on  us  all  [72]  day, not</p>
      <p>since shaving. This afternoon everything is matching up. When the swing shift comes on duty the</p>
      <p>clock  says  four-thirty,  just  like  it  should.  The  Big  Nurse  dismisses  the  black  boys  and  takes  a  last</p>
      <p>look around the ward. She slides a long silver hatpin out of the iron-blue knot of hair back of her</p>
      <p>head, takes off her white cap and sets it careful in a cardboard box (there’s mothballs in that box),</p>
      <p>and drives the hatpin back in the hair with a stab of her hand.</p>
      <p>Behind  the  glass  I  see  her  tell  everyone  good  evening.  She  hands  the  little  birthmarked  swing-</p>
      <p>shift nurse a note; then her hand reaches out to the control panel in the steel door, clacks on the</p>
      <p>speaker in the day room: “Good evening, boys. Behave yourselves.” And turns the music up louder</p>
      <p>than ever. She rubs the inside of her wrist across her window; a disgusted look shows the fat black</p>
      <p>boy who just reported on duty that he better get to cleaning it, and he’s  at the glass with a paper</p>
      <p>towel before she’s so much as locked the ward door behind her.</p>
      <p>The machinery in the walls whistles, sighs, drops into a lower gear.</p>
      <p>Then, till night, we eat and shower and go back to sit  in the day room. Old Blastic, the oldest</p>
      <p>Vegetable,  is  holding  his  stomach  and  moaning.  George  (the  black  boys  call  him  Ruba-dub)  is</p>
      <p>washing  his  hands  in  the  drinking  fountain.  The  Acutes  sit  and  play  cards  and  work  at  getting  a</p>
      <p>picture on our TV set by carrying the set every place the cord will reach, in search of a good beam.</p>
      <p>The speakers in the ceiling are still making music. The music from the speakers isn’t transmitted</p>
      <p>in on a radio beam is why the machinery don’t interfere. The music comes off a long tape from the</p>
      <p>Nurses’ Station, a tape we all know so well by heart that there don’t any of us consciously hear it</p>
      <p>except new men like McMurphy. He hasn’t got used to it yet. He’s dealing blackjack for cigarettes,</p>
      <p>and the speaker’s right over the card table. He’s pulled his cap way forward till he has to lean his</p>
      <p>head back and squint from under the brim to see his cards. He holds a cigarette between his teeth</p>
      <p>and talks around it like a stock auctioneer I saw once in a cattle auction in The Dalles.</p>
      <p>“... hey-ya, hey-ya, come on, come on,” he says, high, fast; “I’m waitin’ on you suckers, you hit or</p>
      <p>you  sit.  Hit,  you  say?  well  well  well  and  with  a  king  up  the  boy  wants  a  hit.  Whaddaya  know.  So</p>
      <p>Comin’ at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he’s over the wall and down the road, up the</p>
      <p>hill and dropped his load. Comin’ at you, Scanlon, and I wish some [73] idiot in that nurses’ hothouse would</p>
      <p>turn down that frigging music! Hooee! Does that thing play night and day, Harding? I never heard such a</p>
      <p>driving racket in my life.”</p>
      <p>Harding gives him a blank look. “Exactly what noise is it you’re referring to, Mr. McMurphy?”</p>
      <p>“That damned radio. Boy. It’s been going ever since I come in this morning. And don’t come on</p>
      <p>with some baloney that you don’t hear it.”</p>
      <p>Harding cocks his ear to the ceiling. “Oh, yes, the so-called music. Yes, I suppose we do hear it if</p>
      <p>we concentrate, but then one can hear one’s own heartbeat too, if he concentrates hard enough.” He</p>
      <p>grins at McMurphy. “You see, that’s a recording playing up there, my friend. We seldom hear the</p>
      <p>radio. The world news might not be therapeutic. And we’ve all heard that recording so many times</p>
      <p>now it simply slides out of our hearing, the way the sound of a waterfall soon becomes an unheard</p>
      <p>sound  to those  who  live  near  it.  Do you  think  if  you  lived  near  a  waterfall  you  could  hear  it  very</p>
      <p>long?”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>46</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>(I  still  hear  the  sound  of  the  falls  on  the  Columbia,  always  will—always—hear  the  whoop  of</p>
      <p>Charley Bear Belly stabbed himself a big chinook, hear the slap of fish in the water, laughing naked</p>
      <p>kids on the bank, the women at the racks ... from a long time ago.)</p>
      <p>“Do they leave it on all the time, like a waterfall?” McMurphy says.</p>
      <p>“Not when we sleep,” Cheswick says, “but all the rest of the time, and that’s the truth.”</p>
      <p>“The hell with that. I’ll tell that coon over there to turn it off or get his fat little ass kicked!”</p>
      <p>He starts to stand up, and Harding touches his arm. “Friend, that is exactly the kind of statement</p>
      <p>that gets one branded assaultive. Are you so eager to forfeit the bet?”</p>
      <p>McMurphy looks at him. “That’s the way it is, huh? A pressure game? Keep the old pinch on?”</p>
      <p>“That’s the way it is.”</p>
      <p>He slowly lowers himself back into his seat, saying, “Horse muh-noo-ur.”</p>
      <p>Harding looks about at the other Acutes around the card table. “Gentlemen, already I seem to</p>
      <p>detect in our redheaded challenger a most unheroic decline of his TV-cowboy stoicism.”</p>
      <p>He looks at McMurphy across the table, smiling, McMurphy nods at him and tips his head back</p>
      <p>for the wink and licks his big thumb. “Well sir, of Professor Harding sounds like he’s [74] getting</p>
      <p>cocky. He wins a couple of splits and he goes to comin’ on like a wise guy. Well well well; there he</p>
      <p>sits with a deuce showing and here’s a pack of Mar-boros says he backs down. … Whups, he sees</p>
      <p>me, okeedokee, Perfessor, here’s a trey, he wants another, gets another deuce, try for the big five,</p>
      <p>Perfessor? Try for that big double pay, or play it safe? Another pack says you won’t. Well well well,</p>
      <p>the Perfessor sees me, this tells the tale, too bad, another lady and the Perfessor flunks his exams. …”</p>
      <p>The  next  song  starts  up  from the  speaker,  loud  and  clangy  and  a  lot  of  accordion.  McMurphy</p>
      <p>takes a look up at the speaker, and his spiel gets louder and louder to match it.</p>
      <p>“... hey-ya hey-ya, okay, next, goddammit, you hit or you sit ... comin at ya ...!”</p>
      <p>Right up to the lights out at nine-thirty.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>I could of watched McMurphy at that blackjack table all night, the way he dealt and talked and</p>
      <p>roped them in and led them smack up to the point where they were just about to quit, then backed</p>
      <p>down a hand or two to give them confidence and bring them along again. Once he took a break for</p>
      <p>a  cigarette  and  tilted back  in  his  chair, his  hands  folded  behind  his  head,  and  told  the  guys,  “The</p>
      <p>secret of being a top-notch con man is being able to know what the mark wants, and how to make</p>
      <p>him think he’s getting it. I learned that when I worked a season on a skillo wheel in a carnival. You</p>
      <p>fe-e-el the sucker over with your eyes when he comes up and you say, ‘Now here’s a bird that needs to</p>
      <p>feel tough.’ So every time he snaps at you for taking him you quake in your boots, scared to death,</p>
      <p>and  tell  him,  ‘Please,  sir.  No  trouble.  The  next  roll  is  on  the  house,  sir.’  So  the  both  of  you  are</p>
      <p>getting what you want.”</p>
      <p>He rocks forward, and the legs of his chair come down with a crack. He picks up the deck, zips</p>
      <p>his thumb over it, knocks the edge of it against the table top, licks his thumb and finger.</p>
      <p>“And what I deduce you marks need is a big fat pot to temptate you. Here’s ten packages on the</p>
      <p>next deal. Hey-yah, comin’ at you, guts ball from here on out. ...”</p>
      <p>And throws back his head and laughs out loud at the way the guys hustled to get their bets down.</p>
      <p>That laugh banged around the day room all evening, and all the time he was dealing he was joking</p>
      <p>and talking and trying to get the players to laugh along with him. But they were all afraid to loosen</p>
      <p>up; it’d been too long. He gave up trying and settled down to serious dealing. They won the deal off</p>
      <p>him [75] a time or two, but he always bought it back or fought it back, and the cigarettes on each</p>
      <p>side of him grew in bigger and bigger pyramid stacks.</p>
      <p>Then  just  before  nine-thirty  he  started  letting  them  win,  lets  them  win  it  all  back  so  fast  they</p>
      <p>don’t hardly remember losing. He pays out the last couple of cigarettes and lays down the deck and</p>
      <p>leans back with a sigh and shoves the cap out of his eyes, and the game is done.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>47</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Well, sir, win a few, lose the rest is what I say.” He shakes his head so forlorn. “I don’t know—I</p>
      <p>was always a pretty shrewd customer at twenty-one, but you birds may just be too tough for me. You</p>
      <p>got some kinda uncanny knack, makes a man leery of playing against such sharpies for real money</p>
      <p>tomorrow.”</p>
      <p>He isn’t even kidding himself into thinking they fall for that. He let them win, and every one of</p>
      <p>us  watching  the  game  knows  it.  So  do  the  players.  But  there  still  isn’t  a  man  raking  his  pile  of</p>
      <p>cigarettes—cigarettes  he  didn’t  really  win  but  only  won  back  because  they  were  his  in  the  first</p>
      <p>place—that doesn’t have a smirk on his face like he’s the toughest gambler on the whole Mississippi.</p>
      <p>The  fat black  boy  and  a black  boy named Geever run  us  out  of  the  day room  and commence</p>
      <p>turning lights off with a little key on a chain, and as the ward gets dimmer and darker the eyes of the</p>
      <p>little birthmarked nurse in the station get bigger and brighter. She’s at the door of the glass station,</p>
      <p>issuing nighttime pills to the men that shuffle past her in a line, and she’s having a hard time keeping</p>
      <p>straight who gets poisoned with what tonight. She’s not even watching where she pours the water.</p>
      <p>What has distracted her attention this way is that big redheaded man with the dreadful cap and the</p>
      <p>horrible-looking scar, coming her way. She’s watching McMurphy walk away from the card table in</p>
      <p>the dark day room, his one horny hand twisting the red tuft of hair that sticks out of the little cup at</p>
      <p>the throat of his work-farm shirt, and I figure by the way she rears back when he reaches the door of</p>
      <p>the  station  that  she’s  probably  been  warned  about  him  beforehand  by  the  Big  Nurse.  (“Oh,  one</p>
      <p>more thing before I leave it in your hands tonight, Miss Pilbow; that new man sitting over there, the</p>
      <p>one with the garish red sideburns and facial lacerations—I’ve reason to believe he is a sex maniac.”)</p>
      <p>McMurphy  sees  how  she’s  looking  so  scared  and  big-eyed  at  him,  so  he  sticks  his  head  in  the</p>
      <p>station door where she’s issuing pills, and gives her a big friendly grin to get acquainted [76] on. This</p>
      <p>flusters her so she drops the water pitcher on her foot. She gives a cry and hops on one foot, jerks</p>
      <p>her hand, and the pill she was about to give me leaps out of the little cup and right down the neck of</p>
      <p>her uniform where that birthmark stain runs like a river of wine down into a valley.</p>
      <p>“Let me give you a hand, ma’am.”</p>
      <p>And that very hand comes through the station door, scarred and tattooed and the color of raw</p>
      <p>meat.</p>
      <p>“Stay back! There are two aides on the ward with me!”</p>
      <p>She  rolls  her  eyes  for  the  black  boys,  but  they  are  off  tying  Chronics  in  bed,  nowhere  close</p>
      <p>enough to help in a hurry. McMurphy grins and turns the hand over so she can see he isn’t holding a</p>
      <p>knife. All she can see is the light shining off the slick, waxy, callused palm.</p>
      <p>“All I mean to do, miss, is to—”</p>
      <p>“Stay back! Patients aren’t allowed to enter the—Oh, stay back, I’m a Catholic!” and straightaway</p>
      <p>jerks at the gold chain around her neck so a cross flies out from between her bosoms, slingshots the</p>
      <p>lost pill up in the air! McMurphy strikes at the air right in front of her face. She screams and pops</p>
      <p>the  cross  in her  mouth  and  clinches her eyes  shut like  she’s  about  to  get  socked,  stands  like  that,</p>
      <p>paper-white except for that stain which turns darker than ever, as though it sucked the blood from</p>
      <p>all  the  rest  of  her body.  When  she  finally  opens  her  eyes  again  there’s  that  callused  hand  right  in</p>
      <p>front of her with my little red capsule sitting in it.</p>
      <p>“—was to pick up your waterin’ can you dropped.” He holds that out in the other hand.</p>
      <p>Her breath comes out in a loud hiss. She takes the can from him. “Thank you. Good night, good</p>
      <p>night,” and closes the door in the next man’s face, no more pills tonight.</p>
      <p>In the dorm McMurphy tosses the pill on my bed. “You want your sourball, Chief?”</p>
      <p>I shake my head at the pill,  and he flips it off the  bed like  it was a bug pestering him. It hops</p>
      <p>across the floor with a cricket scrabble. He goes to getting ready for bed, pulling off his clothes. The</p>
      <p>shorts  under his  work  pants  are  coal  black  satin  covered  with  big  white  whales  with red  eyes.  He</p>
      <p>grins  when  he  sees  I’m  looking  at  the  shorts.  “From  a  co-ed  at  Oregon  State,  Chief,  a  Literary</p>

      <p>48</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>major.”  He  snaps  the  elastic  with  his  thumb.  “She  gave  them  to  me  because  she  said  I  was  a</p>
      <p>symbol.”</p>
      <p>His arms and neck and face are sunburned and bristled with curly orange hairs. He’s got tattoos</p>
      <p>on each big shoulder; one [77] says “Fighting Leathernecks” and has a devil with a red eye and red</p>
      <p>horns and an M-1 rifle, and the other is a poker hand fanned out across his muscle—aces and eights.</p>
      <p>He puts his roll of clothes on the nightstand next to my bed and goes to punching at his pillow. He’s</p>
      <p>been assigned the bed right next to mine.</p>
      <p>He gets between the sheets and tells me I better hit the sack myself, that here comes one of those</p>
      <p>black boys to douse the lights on us. I look around, and the black boy named Geever is coming, and</p>
      <p>I kick off my shoes and get in bed just as he walks up to tie a sheet across me. When he’s finished</p>
      <p>with me he takes a last look around and giggles and flips the dorm lights off.</p>
      <p>Except for the white powder of light from the Nurses’ Station out in the hall, the dorm is dark. I</p>
      <p>can just make out McMurphy next to me, breathing deep and regular, the covers over him rising and</p>
      <p>falling. The breathing gets slower and slower, till I figure he’s been asleep for a while. Then I hear a</p>
      <p>soft, throaty sound from his bed, like the chuckle of a horse. He’s still awake and he’s laughing to</p>
      <p>himself about something.</p>
      <p>He stops laughing and whispers, “Why, you sure did give a jump when I told you that coon was</p>
      <p>coming, Chief. I thought somebody told me you was deef.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>49</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>7</p>
      <p>First time for a long, long time I’m in bed without taking that little red capsule (if I hide to keep</p>
      <p>from taking it, the night nurse with the birthmark sends the black boy named Geever out to hunt me</p>
      <p>down, hold me captive with his flashlight till she can get the needle ready), so I fake sleep when the</p>
      <p>black boy’s coming past with his light.</p>
      <p>When you take one of those red pills you don’t just go to sleep; you’re paralyzed with sleep, and</p>
      <p>all night long you can’t wake, no matter what goes on around you. That’s why the staff gives me the</p>
      <p>pills; at the old place I took to waking up at night and catching them performing all kinds of horrible</p>
      <p>crimes on the patients sleeping around me.</p>
      <p>I lie still and slow my breathing, waiting to see if something is going to happen. It is dark my lord</p>
      <p>and I hear them slipping around out there in their rubber shoes; twice they peek in the dorm and</p>
      <p>run a flashlight over everybody. I keep my eyes shut and keep awake. I hear a wailing from up on</p>
      <p>Disturbed, loo loo looo—got some guy wired to pick up code signals.</p>
      <p>“Oh, a beer, I think, fo’ the long night ahead,” I hear a black boy whisper to the other. Rubber</p>
      <p>shoes squeak off toward the Nurses’ Station, where the refrigerator is. “You like a beer, sweet thing</p>
      <p>with a birthmark? Fo’ the long night ahead?”</p>
      <p>The guy upstairs hushes. The low whine of the devices in the walls gets quieter and quieter, till it</p>
      <p>hums  down  to  nothing.  Not  a  sound  across  the  hospital—except  for  a  dull,  padded  rumbling</p>
      <p>somewhere  deep  in  the  guts  of  the  building,  a  sound  that  I  never  noticed  before—a  lot  like  the</p>
      <p>sound you hear when you’re standing late at night on top of a big hydroelectric dam. Low, relentless,</p>
      <p>brute power.</p>
      <p>The  fat  black  boy  stands  out  there  in  the  hall  where  I  can  see  him,  looking  all  around  and</p>
      <p>giggling. He walks toward the dorm door, slow, wiping the wet gray palms in his armpits. The light</p>
      <p>from the Nurses’ Station throws his shadow on the dorm wall big as an elephant, gets smaller as he</p>
      <p>walks to the dorm door and looks in. He giggles again and unlocks the [79] fuse box by the door and</p>
      <p>reaches in. “Tha’s right, babies, sleep tight.”</p>
      <p>Twists a knob, and the whole floor goes to slipping down away from him standing in the door,</p>
      <p>lowering into the building like a platform in a grain elevator!</p>
      <p>Not a thing but the dorm floor moves, and we’re sliding away from the walls and door and the</p>
      <p>windows of the ward at a hell of a clip—beds, bedstands, and all. The machinery—probably a cog-</p>
      <p>and-track affair at each corner of the shaft-is greased silent as death. The only sound I hear is the</p>
      <p>guys breathing, and that drumming under us getting louder the farther down we go. The light of the</p>
      <p>dorm door five hundred yards back up this hole is nothing but a speck, dusting the square sides of</p>
      <p>the shaft with a dim powder. It gets dimmer and dimmer till a faraway scream comes echoing down</p>
      <p>the sides of the shaft—“Stay back!”—and the light goes out altogether.</p>
      <p>The floor reaches some kind of solid bottom far down in the ground and stops with a soft jar.</p>
      <p>It’s  dead  black,  and  I  can  feel  the  sheet  around  me  choking  off  my  wind.  Just  as  I  get  the  sheet</p>
      <p>untied, the floor starts sliding forward with a little jolt. Some kind of castors under it I can’t hear. I</p>
      <p>can’t  even  hear  the  guys  around  me  breathing,  and  I  realize  all  of  a  sudden  it’s  because  that</p>
      <p>drumming’s gradually got so loud I can’t hear anything else. We must be square in the middle of it. I</p>
      <p>go to clawing at that damned sheet tied across me and just about have it loose when a whole wall</p>
      <p>slides  up,  reveals  a  huge  room  of  endless  machines  stretching  clear  out  of  sight,  swarming  with</p>
      <p>sweating, shirtless men running up and down catwalks, faces blank and dreamy in firelight thrown</p>
      <p>from a hundred blast furnaces.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>50</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>It—everything  I  see—looks  like  it  sounded,  like  the  inside  of  a  tremendous  dam.  Huge  brass</p>
      <p>tubes disappear upward in the dark. Wires run to transformers out of sight. Grease and cinders catch</p>
      <p>on everything, staining the couplings and motors and dynamos red and coal black.</p>
      <p>The workers all move at the same smooth sprint, an easy, fluid stride. No one’s in a hurry. One</p>
      <p>will hold up  a second, spin a dial, push a button, throw a switch, and one side of his face flashes</p>
      <p>white like lightning from the spark of the connecting switch, and run on, up steel steps and along a</p>
      <p>corrugated iron catwalk—pass each other so smooth and close I hear the slap of wet sides like the</p>
      <p>slap of a salmon’s tail on water—stop again, throw lightning from another switch, and run on again.</p>
      <p>[80] They twinkle in all directions clean on out of sight, these flash pictures of the dreamy doll faces</p>
      <p>of the workmen.</p>
      <p>A workman’s eyes snap shut while he’s going at full run, and he drops in his tracks; two of his</p>
      <p>buddies running by grab him up and lateral him into a furnace as they pass. The furnace whoops a</p>
      <p>ball of fire and I hear the popping of a million tubes like walking through a field of seed pods. This</p>
      <p>sound mixes with the whirr and clang of the rest of the machines.</p>
      <p>There’s a rhythm to it, like a thundering pulse.</p>
      <p>The dorm floor slides on out of the shaft and into the machine room. Right away I see what’s</p>
      <p>straight above us—one of those trestle affairs like you find in meat houses, rollers on tracks to move</p>
      <p>carcasses from the cooler to the butcher without much lifting. Two guys in slacks, white shirts with</p>
      <p>the sleeves turned back, and thin black ties are leaning on the catwalk above our beds, gesturing to</p>
      <p>each other as they talk, cigarettes in long holders tracing lines of red light. They’re talking but you</p>
      <p>can’t make out the words above the measured roar rising all around them. One of the guys snaps his</p>
      <p>fingers, and the nearest workman veers in a sharp turn and sprints to his side. The guy points down</p>
      <p>at one of the beds with his cigarette holder, and the worker trots off to the steel stepladder and runs</p>
      <p>down to our level, where he goes out of sight between two transformers huge as potato cellars.</p>
      <p>When that worker appears again he’s pulling a hook along the trestle overhead and taking giant</p>
      <p>strides as he swings along it. He passes my bed and a furnace whooping somewhere suddenly lights</p>
      <p>his face up right over mine, a face handsome and brutal and waxy like a mask, wanting nothing. I’ve</p>
      <p>seen a million faces like it.</p>
      <p>He goes to the bed and with one hand grabs the old Vegetable Blastic by the heel and lifts him</p>
      <p>straight up like Blastic don’t weigh more’n a few pounds; with the other hand the worker drives the</p>
      <p>hook through the tendon back of the heel, and the old guy’s hanging there upside down, his moldy</p>
      <p>face blown up big, scared, the eyes scummed with mute fear. He keeps flapping both arms and the</p>
      <p>free leg till his pajama top falls around his head. The worker grabs the top and bunches and twists it</p>
      <p>like a burlap sack and pulls the trolley clicking back over the trestle to the catwalk and looks up to</p>
      <p>where those two guys in white shirts are standing. One of the guys takes a scalpel from a holster at</p>
      <p>his belt. There’s a chain welded to the scalpel. The guy lowers it to the worker, loops the other end</p>
      <p>of the chain around the railing so the worker can’t run off with a weapon.</p>
      <p>[81] The worker takes the scalpel and slices up the front of old Blastic with a clean swing and the</p>
      <p>old man stops thrashing around. I expect to be sick, but there’s no blood or innards falling out like I</p>
      <p>was  looking  to  see—just  a  shower  of  rust  and  ashes,  and  now  and  again  a  piece  of  wire  or  glass.</p>
      <p>Worker’s standing there to his knees in what looks like clinkers.</p>
      <p>A furnace got its mouth open somewhere, licks up somebody.</p>
      <p>I  think  about  jumping  up  and  running  around  and  waking  up  McMurphy  and  Harding  and  as</p>
      <p>many of the guys as I can, but there wouldn’t be any sense in it. If I shook somebody awake he’d</p>
      <p>say, Why you crazy idiot, what the hell’s eating you? And then probably help one of the workers lift</p>
      <p>me onto one of those hooks himself, saying, How about let’s see what the insides of an Indian are</p>
      <p>like?</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>51</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>I  hear  the  high,  cold,  whistling  wet  breath  of  the  fog  machine,  see  the  first  wisps  of  it  come</p>
      <p>seeping out from under McMurphy’s bed. I hope he knows enough to hide in the fog.</p>
      <p>I hear a silly prattle reminds me of somebody familiar, and I roll enough to get a look down the</p>
      <p>other way. It’s the hairless Public Relation with the bloated face, that the patients are always arguing</p>
      <p>about why it’s bloated. “I’ll say he does,” they’ll argue. “Me, I’ll say he doesn’t; you ever hear of a guy</p>
      <p>really who wore one?” “Yeh, but you ever hear of a guy like him before?” The first patient shrugs and</p>
      <p>nods, “Interesting point.”</p>
      <p>Now he’s stripped except for a long undershirt with fancy monograms sewed red on front and</p>
      <p>back. And I see once and for all (the undershirt rides up his back some as he comes walking past,</p>
      <p>giving me a peek) that he definitely does wear one, laced so tight it might blow up any second.</p>
      <p>And dangling from the stays he’s got half a dozen withered objects, tied by the hair like scalps.</p>
      <p>He’s carrying a little flask of something that he sips from to keep his throat open for talking, and</p>
      <p>a  camphor  hanky  he puts  in  front of  his  nose  from  time  to  time  to  stop  out  the  stink.  There’s  a</p>
      <p>clutch of schoolteachers and college girls and the like hurrying after him. They wear blue aprons and</p>
      <p>their hair in pin curls. They are listening to him give a brief lecture on the tour.</p>
      <p>He thinks of something funny and has to stop his lecture long enough for a swig from the flask</p>
      <p>to  stop  the  giggling.  During  the  pause  one  of  his  pupils  stargazes  around  and  sees  the  gutted</p>
      <p>Chronic dangling by his heel. She gasps and jumps back. The Public Relation turns and catches sight</p>
      <p>of the corpse and rushes to take one of those limp hands and give it a spin. The [82] student shrinks</p>
      <p>forward for a cautious look, face in a trance.</p>
      <p>“You see? You see?” He squeals and rolls his eyes and spews stuff from his flask he’s laughing so</p>
      <p>hard. He’s laughing till i think he’ll explode.</p>
      <p>When he finally drowns the laughing he starts back along the row of machines and goes into his</p>
      <p>lecture  again.  He  stops  suddenly  and  slaps  his  forehead—“Oh,  scatterbrained  me!”—and  comes</p>
      <p>running back to the hanging Chronic to rip off another trophy and tie it to his girdle.</p>
      <p>Right and left there are other things happening just as bad—crazy, horrible things too goofy and</p>
      <p>outlandish  to  cry  about  and too  much true to  laugh  about—but  the  fog  is  getting thick  enough  I</p>
      <p>don’t  have  to  watch.  And  somebody’s  tugging  at  my  arm.  I  know  already  what  will  happen:</p>
      <p>somebody’ll drag me out of the fog and we’ll be back on the ward and there won’t be a sign of what</p>
      <p>went on tonight and if I was fool enough to try and tell anybody about it they’d say, Idiot, you just</p>
      <p>had a nightmare; things as crazy as a big machine room down in the bowels of a dam where people</p>
      <p>get cut up by robot workers don’t exist.</p>
      <p>But if they don’t exist, how can a man see them?</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>It’s Mr. Turkle that pulls me out of the fog by the arm, shaking me and grinning. He says, “You</p>
      <p>havin’ a bad dream, Mistuh Bromden.” He’s the aide works the long lonely shift from 11 to 7, an old</p>
      <p>Negro man with a big sleepy grin on the end of a long wobbly neck. He smells like he’s had a little</p>
      <p>to drink. “Back to sleep now, Mistuh Bromden.”</p>
      <p>Some nights he’ll untie the sheet from across me if it’s so tight I squirm around. He wouldn’t do</p>
      <p>it if he thought the day crew knew it was him, because they’d probably fire him, but he figures the</p>
      <p>day crew will think it was me untied it. I think he really does it to be kind, to help—but he makes</p>
      <p>sure he’s safe first.</p>
      <p>This  time  he  doesn’t  untie  the  sheet  but  walks  away  from  me  to  help  two  aides  I  never  saw</p>
      <p>before  and  a  young  doctor  lift  old  Blastic  onto  the  stretcher  and  carry  him  out,  covered  with  a</p>
      <p>sheet—handle him more careful than anybody ever handled him before in all his life.</p>

      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>8</p>
      <p>Come morning, McMurphy is up before I am, the first time anybody been up before me since</p>
      <p>Uncle Jules the Wallwalker was here. Jules was a shrewd old white-haired Negro with a theory the</p>
      <p>world was being tipped over on its side during the night by the black boys; he used to slip out in the</p>
      <p>early mornings, aiming to catch them tipping it. Like Jules, I’m up early in the mornings to watch</p>
      <p>what machinery they’re sneaking onto the ward or installing in the shaving room, and usually it’s just</p>
      <p>me and the black boys in the hall for fifteen minutes before the next patient is out of bed. But this</p>
      <p>morning I hear McMurphy out there in the latrine as I come out of the covers. Hear him singing!</p>
      <p>Singing so you’d think he didn’t have a worry in the world. His voice is clear and strong slapping up</p>
      <p>against the cement and steel.</p>
      <p>“ ‘Your horses are hungry, that’s what she did say.’ ” He’s enjoying the way the sound rings in the</p>
      <p>latrine.  “  ‘Come  sit  down  beside  me,  an’  feed  them  some  hay.’  ”  He  gets  a  breath,  and  his  voice</p>
      <p>jumps a key, gaining pitch and power till it’s joggling the wiring in all the walls. “ ‘My horses ain’t</p>
      <p>hungry, they won’t eat your hay-ay-aeee.’ ” He holds the note and plays with it, then swoops down</p>
      <p>with the rest of the verse to finish it off. “ ‘So fare-thee-well, darlin’, I’m gone on my way.’ ”</p>
      <p>Singing! Everybody’s thunderstruck. They haven’t heard such a thing in years, not on this ward.</p>
      <p>Most  of  the  Acutes  in  the  dorm  are  up  on  their  elbows,  blinking  and  listening.  They  look  at  one</p>
      <p>another and raise their eyebrows. How come the black boys haven’t hushed him up out there? They</p>
      <p>never  let  anybody  raise  that  much  racket  before,  did  they?  How  come  they  treat  this  new  guy</p>
      <p>different? He’s a man made outa skin and bone that’s due to get weak and pale and die, just like the</p>
      <p>rest of us. He lives under the same laws, gotta eat, bumps up against the same troubles; these things</p>
      <p>make him just as vulnerable to the Combine as anybody else, don’t they?</p>
      <p>But the new guy is different, and the Acutes can see it, different from anybody been coming on</p>
      <p>this  ward  for  the  past  ten  years,  different  from  anybody  they  ever  met  outside.  He’s  just  as</p>
      <p>vulnerable, maybe, but the Combine didn’t get him.</p>
      <p>[84] “ ‘My wagons are loaded,’ ” he sings, “ ‘my whip’s in my hand ...’ ”</p>
      <p>How’d  he manage  to  slip  the  collar?  Maybe,  like  old  Pete,  the  Combine  missed  getting  to  him</p>
      <p>soon enough with controls. Maybe he growed up so wild all over the country, batting around from</p>
      <p>one place to another, never around one town longer’n a few months when he was a kid so a school</p>
      <p>never got much a hold on him, logging, gambling, running carnival wheels, traveling lightfooted and</p>
      <p>fast, keeping on the move so much that the Combine never had a chance to get anything installed.</p>
      <p>Maybe that’s it, he never gave the Combine a chance, just like he never gave the black boy a chance</p>
      <p>to get to him with the thermometer yesterday morning, because a moving target is hard to hit.</p>
      <p>No wife wanting new linoleum. No relatives pulling at him with watery old eyes. No one to care</p>
      <p>about, which is what makes him free enough to be a good con man. And maybe the reason the black</p>
      <p>boys  don’t  rush  into  that  latrine  and  put  a  stop  to  his  singing  is  because  they  know  he’s  out  of</p>
      <p>control, and they remember that time with old Pete and what a man out of control can do. And they</p>
      <p>can see that McMurphy’s a lot bigger than old Pete; if it comes down to getting the best of him, it’s</p>
      <p>going to take all three of them and the Big Nurse waiting on the sidelines with a needle. The Acutes</p>
      <p>nod  at  one  another;  that’s  the  reason, they  figure,  that the  black  boys  haven’t  stopped  his  singing</p>
      <p>where they would stop any of the rest of us.</p>
      <p>I come out of the dorm into the hall just as McMurphy comes out of the latrine. He’s got his cap</p>
      <p>on and not much else, just a towel grabbed around his hips. He’s holding a toothbrush in his other</p>
      <p>hand. He stands in the hall, looking up and down, rocking up on his toes to keep off the cold tile as</p>
      <p>much as he can. Picks him out a black boy, the least one, and walks up to him and whaps him on the</p>
      <p>shoulder just like they’d been friends all their lives.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>53</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Hey there, old buddy, what’s my chance of gettin’ some toothpaste for brushin’ my grinders?”</p>
      <p>The black boy’s dwarf head swivels and comes nose to knuckle with that hand. He frowns at it,</p>
      <p>then  takes  a  quick  check  where’s  the  other two  black  boys  just  in  case,  and  tells  McMurphy  they</p>
      <p>don’t open the cabinet till six-forty-five. “It’s a policy,” he says.</p>
      <p>“Is that right? I mean, is that where they keep the toothpaste? In the cabinet?”</p>
      <p>“Tha’s right, locked in the cabinet.”</p>
      <p>[85] The black boy tries to go back to polishing the baseboards, but that hand is still lopped over</p>
      <p>his shoulder like a big red clamp.</p>
      <p>“Locked in the cabinet, is it? Well well well, now why do you reckon they keep the toothpaste</p>
      <p>locked up? I mean, it ain’t like it’s dangerous, is it? You can’t poison a man with it, can you? You</p>
      <p>couldn’t brain some guy with the tube, could you? What reason you suppose they have for puttin’</p>
      <p>something as harmless as a little tube of toothpaste under lock and key?”</p>
      <p>“It’s ward policy, Mr. McMurphy, tha’s the reason.” And when he sees that this last reason don’t</p>
      <p>affect McMurphy like it should, he frowns at that hand on his shoulder and adds, “What you s’pose</p>
      <p>it’d be like if evahbody was to brush their teeth whenever they took a notion to brush?”</p>
      <p>McMurphy  turns  loose  the  shoulder,  tugs  at  that  tuft  of  red  wool  at  his  neck,  and  thinks  this</p>
      <p>over. “Uh-huh, uh-huh, I think I can see what you’re drivin’ at: ward policy is for those that can’t</p>
      <p>brush after every meal.”</p>
      <p>“My gaw, don’t you see?”</p>
      <p>“Yes, now, I do. You’re saying people’d be brushin’ their teeth whenever the spirit moved them.”</p>
      <p>“Tha’s right, tha’s why we—”</p>
      <p>“And, lordy, can you imagine? Teeth bein’ brushed at six-thirty, six-twenty—who can tell? maybe</p>
      <p>even six o’clock. Yeah, I can see your point.”</p>
      <p>He winks past the black boy at me standing against the wall.</p>
      <p>“I gotta get this baseboard cleaned, McMurphy.”</p>
      <p>“Oh. I didn’t mean to keep you from your job.” He starts to back away as the black boy bends to</p>
      <p>his work again. Then he comes forward and leans  over to look in the can at the black boy’s side.</p>
      <p>“Well, look here; what do we have here?”</p>
      <p>The black boy peers down. “Look where?”</p>
      <p>“Look here in this old can, Sam. What is the stuff in this old can?”</p>
      <p>“Tha’s … soap powder.”</p>
      <p>“Well,  I  generally  use  paste,  but”—McMurphy  runs  his  toothbrush  down  in  the  powder  and</p>
      <p>swishes it around and pulls it out and taps it on the side of the can—“but this will do fine for me. I</p>
      <p>thank you. We’ll look into that ward policy business later.”</p>
      <p>And he heads back to the latrine, where I can hear his singing garbled by the piston beat of his</p>
      <p>toothbrushing.</p>
      <p>That  black  boy’s  standing  there  looking  after  him  with  his  scrub  rag  hanging  limp  in  his  gray</p>
      <p>hand. After a minute he [86] blinks and looks around and sees I been watching and comes over and</p>
      <p>drags me down the hall by the drawstring on my pajamas and pushes me to a place on the floor I</p>
      <p>just did yesterday.</p>
      <p>“There! Damn you, right there! That’s where I want you workin’, not gawkin’ around like some</p>
      <p>big useless cow! There! There!”</p>
      <p>And I lean over and go to mopping with my back to him so he won’t see me grin. I feel good,</p>
      <p>seeing McMurphy get that black boy’s goat like not many men could. Papa used to be able to do it—</p>
      <p>spraddle-legged, dead-panned, squinting up at the sky that first time the government men showed up</p>
      <p>to  negotiate  about  buying  off  the  treaty.  “Canada  honkers  up  there,”  Papa  says,  squinting  up.</p>
      <p>Government men look, rattling papers. “What are you—? In July? There’s no—uh—geese this time</p>
      <p>of year. Uh, no geese.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>54</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>They  had  been  talking  like  tourists  from  the  East  who  figure  you’ve  got  to  talk  to  Indians  so</p>
      <p>they’ll understand. Papa didn’t seem to take any notice of the way they talked. He kept looking at the</p>
      <p>sky. “Geese up there, white man. You know it. Geese this year. And last year. And the year before</p>
      <p>and the year before.”</p>
      <p>The  men  looked  at  one  another  and  cleared  their  throats.  “Yes.  Maybe  true,  Chief  Bromden.</p>
      <p>Now.  Forget  geese.  Pay  attention  to  contract.  What  we  offer  could  greatly  benefit  you—your</p>
      <p>people—change the lives of the red man.”</p>
      <p>Papa said, “... and the year before and the year before and the year before ...”</p>
      <p>By the time it dawned on the government men that they were being poked fun at, all the council</p>
      <p>who’d been sitting on the porch of our shack, putting pipes in the pockets of their red and black</p>
      <p>plaid wool shirts and taking them back out again, grinning at one another and at Papa—they had all</p>
      <p>busted up laughing fit to kill. Uncle R &amp; J Wolf was rolling on the ground, gasping with laughter and</p>
      <p>saying, “You know it, white man.”</p>
      <p>It sure did get their goat; they turned without saying a word and walked off toward the highway,</p>
      <p>red-necked, us laughing behind them. I forget sometimes what laughter can do.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>The  Big  Nurse’s  key  hits  the  lock,  and  the  black  boy  is  up  to  her  soon  as  she’s  in  the  door,</p>
      <p>shifting from foot to foot like a kid asking to pee. I’m close enough I hear McMurphy’s name come</p>
      <p>into his  conversation  a  couple of  times,  so I  know  he’s  telling  her  about  McMurphy  brushing  his</p>
      <p>teeth,  completely  [87]  forgetting  to  tell  her  about  the  old  Vegetable  who  died  during  the  night.</p>
      <p>Waving his arms and trying to tell her what that fool redhead’s been up to already, so early in the</p>
      <p>morning—disrupting things, goin’ contrary to ward policy, can’t she do something?</p>
      <p>She glares at the black boy till he stops fidgeting, then looks up the hall to where McMurphy’s</p>
      <p>singing is booming out of the latrine door louder than ever. “ ‘Oh, your parents don’t like me, they</p>
      <p>say I’m too po-o-or; they say I’m not worthy to enter your door.’ ”</p>
      <p>Her face is puzzled at first; like the rest of us, it’s been so long since she’s heard singing it takes</p>
      <p>her a second to recognize what it is.</p>
      <p>“ ‘Hard livin’s my pleasure, my money’s my o-o-own, an’ them that don’t like me, they can leave</p>
      <p>me alone.’ ”</p>
      <p>She listens a minute more to make sure she isn’t hearing things; then she goes to puffing up. Her</p>
      <p>nostrils flare open, and every breath she draws she gets bigger, as big and tough-looking’s I seen her</p>
      <p>get  over  a  patient  since  Taber  was  here.  She  works  the  hinges  in  her elbows  and  fingers.  I  hear  a</p>
      <p>small squeak. She starts moving, and I get back against the wall, and when she rumbles past she’s</p>
      <p>already  big  as  a  truck,  trailing  that  wicker  bag  behind  in  her  exhaust  like  a  semi  behind  a  Jimmy</p>
      <p>Diesel. Her lips are parted, and her smile’s going out before her like a radiator grill. I can smell the</p>
      <p>hot oil  and  magneto  spark  when  she  goes  past,  and  every  step  hits  the  floor  she  blows  up  a  size</p>
      <p>bigger, blowing and puffing, roll down anything in her path! I’m scared to think what she’ll do.</p>
      <p>Then, just as she’s rolling along at her biggest and meanest, McMurphy steps out of the latrine</p>
      <p>door right in front of her, holding that towel around his hips—stops her dead! She shrinks to about</p>
      <p>head-high to where that towel covers him, and he’s grinning down on her. Her own grin is giving</p>
      <p>way, sagging at the edges.</p>
      <p>“Good morning, Miss Rat-shed! How’s things on the outside?”</p>
      <p>“You can’t run around here—in a towel!”</p>
      <p>“No?” He looks down at the part of the towel she’s eye to eye with, and it’s wet and skin tight.</p>
      <p>“Towels against ward policy too? Well, I guess there’s nothin’ to do exec—”</p>
      <p>“Stop! don’t you dare. You get back in that dorm and get your clothes on this instant!”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>55</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>She sounds like a teacher bawling out a student, so McMurphy hangs his head like a student and</p>
      <p>says in a voice sounds like he’s about to cry, “I can’t do that, ma’am. I’m [88] afraid some thief in the</p>
      <p>night  boosted  my  clothes  whilst  I  slept.  I  sleep  awful  sound  on  the  mattresses  you  have  here.”</p>
      <p>“Somebody boosted ...?”</p>
      <p>“Pinched. Jobbed. Swiped. Stole,” he says happily. “You know, man, like somebody boosted my</p>
      <p>threads.” Saying this tickles him so he goes into a little barefooted dance before her.</p>
      <p>“Stole your clothes?”</p>
      <p>“That looks like the whole of it.”</p>
      <p>“But—prison clothes? Why?”</p>
      <p>He  stops  jigging  around  and  hangs  his  head  again.  “All  I  know  is  that they  were there  when  I</p>
      <p>went to bed and gone when I got up. Gone slick as a whistle. Oh, I do know they were nothing but</p>
      <p>prison clothes, coarse and faded and uncouth, ma’am, well I know it—and prison clothes may not</p>
      <p>seem like much to those as has more. But to a nude man—”</p>
      <p>“That  outfit,”  she  says,  realizing,  “was  supposed  to be  picked  up.  You  were  issued  a  uniform  of</p>
      <p>green convalescents this morning.”</p>
      <p>He shakes his head and sighs, but still don’t look up. “No. No, I’m afraid I wasn’t. Not a thing</p>
      <p>this morning but the cap that’s on my head and—”</p>
      <p>“Williams,” she hollers down to the black boy who’s still at the ward door like he might make a</p>
      <p>run for it. “Williams, can you come here a moment?”</p>
      <p>He crawls to her like a dog to a whipping.</p>
      <p>“Williams, why doesn’t this patient have an issue of convalescents?”</p>
      <p>The black boy is relieved. He straightens up and grins, raises that gray hand and points down the</p>
      <p>other end of the hall to one of the big ones. “Mistuh Washington over there is ‘signed to the laundry</p>
      <p>duty this mornin’. Not me. No.”</p>
      <p>“Mr.  Washington!”  She nails  him  with  his  mop  poised  over  the bucket,  freezes  him  there.  “Will</p>
      <p>you  come  here  a  moment!”  The  mop  slides  without  a  sound  back  in  the  bucket,  and  with  slow,</p>
      <p>careful  movements  he  leans  the  handle  against  the  wall.  He  turns  around  and  looks  down  at</p>
      <p>McMurphy and the least black boy and the nurse. He looks then to his left and to his right, like she</p>
      <p>might be yelling at somebody else.</p>
      <p>“Come down here!”</p>
      <p>He puts his hands in his pockets and starts shuffling down the hall to her. He never walks very</p>
      <p>fast, and I can see how if he don’t get a move on she might freeze him and shatter him all to hell by</p>
      <p>just looking; all the hate and fury and frustration she was planning to use on McMurphy is beaming</p>
      <p>out  down  the  hall  at  the  black  boy,  and  he  can  feel  it  blast  against  him  [89]  like  a  blizzard  wind,</p>
      <p>slowing him more than ever. He has to lean into it, pulling his arms around him. Frost forms in his</p>
      <p>hair and eyebrows. He leans farther forward, but his steps are getting slower; he’ll never make it.</p>
      <p>Then McMurphy takes to whistling “Sweet Georgia Brown,” and the nurse looks away from the</p>
      <p>black boy just in time. Now she’s madder and more frustrated than ever, madder’n I ever saw her</p>
      <p>get. Her doll smile is gone, stretched tight and thin as a red-hot wire. If some of the patients could</p>
      <p>be out to see her now, McMurphy could start collecting his bets.</p>
      <p>The  black  boy  finally  gets  to  her,  and  it  took  him  two  hours.  She  draws  a  long  breath.</p>
      <p>“Washington, why wasn’t this man issued a change of greens this morning? Couldn’t you see he had</p>
      <p>nothing on but a towel?”</p>
      <p>“And my cap,” McMurphy whispers, tapping the brim with his finger.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Washington?”</p>
      <p>The  big  black  boy  looks  at  the  little  one  who  pointed  him  out,  and  the  little  black  boy</p>
      <p>commences to fidget again. The big boy looks at him a long time with those radio-tube eyes, plans</p>
      <p>to square things with him later; then the head turns and he looks McMurphy up and down, taking in</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>56</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>the hard, heavy shoulders, the lopsided grin, the scar on the nose, the hand clamping the towel in</p>
      <p>place, and then he looks at the nurse.</p>
      <p>“I guess—” he starts out.</p>
      <p>“You guess! You’ll do more than guess! You’ll get him a uniform this instant, Mr. Washington, or</p>
      <p>spend the next two weeks working on Geriatrics Ward! Yes. You may need a month of bedpans and</p>
      <p>slab baths to refresh your appreciation of just how little work you aides have to do on this ward. If</p>
      <p>this was one of the other wards, who do you think would be scouring the hall all day? Mr. Bromden</p>
      <p>here? No, you know who it would be. We excuse you aides from most of your housekeeping duties</p>
      <p>to enable you to see to the patients. And that means seeing that they don’t parade around exposed.</p>
      <p>What do you think would have happened if one of the young nurses had come in early and found a</p>
      <p>patient running round the halls without a uniform? What do you think!”</p>
      <p>The big black boy isn’t too sure what, but he gets her drift and ambles off to the linen room to</p>
      <p>get McMurphy a set of greens—probably ten sizes too small—and ambles back and holds it out to</p>
      <p>him with a look of the clearest hate I ever saw. McMurphy just looks confused, like he don’t know</p>
      <p>how to take the outfit the black boy’s handing to him, what with one hand holding the toothbrush</p>
      <p>and the other hand holding up [90] the towel. He finally winks at the nurse and shrugs and unwraps</p>
      <p>the towel, drapes it over her shoulder like she was a wooden rack.</p>
      <p>I see he had his shorts on under the towel all along.</p>
      <p>I think for a fact that she’d rather he’d of been stark naked under that towel than had on those</p>
      <p>shorts. She’s glaring at those big white whales leaping round on his shorts in pure wordless outrage.</p>
      <p>That’s more’n she can take. It’s a full minute before she can pull herself together enough to turn on</p>
      <p>the least black boy; her voice is shaking out of control, she’s so mad.</p>
      <p>“Williams  …  I  believe  …  you  were  supposed  to  have  the  windows  of  the  Nurses’  Station</p>
      <p>polished by the time I arrived this morning.” He scuttles off like a black and white bug. “And you,</p>
      <p>Washington—and you ...” Washington shuffles back to his bucket in almost a trot. She looks around</p>
      <p>again,  wondering  who  else  she  can  light  into.  She  spots  me,  but  by  this  time  some  of  the  other</p>
      <p>patients are out of the dorm and wondering about the little clutch of us here in the hall. She closes</p>
      <p>her eyes and concentrates. She can’t have them see her face like this, white and warped with fury.</p>
      <p>She  uses  all  the  power  of  control that’s  in her.  Gradually  the  lips  gather  together  again  under  the</p>
      <p>little white nose, run together, like the red-hot wire had got hot enough to melt, shimmer a second,</p>
      <p>then  click  solid  as  the  molten  metal  sets,  growing  cold  and  strangely  dull.  Her  lips  part,  and  her</p>
      <p>tongue comes between them, a chunk of slag. Her eyes open again, and they have that strange dull</p>
      <p>and  cold  and  flat  look  the  lips  have,  but  she  goes  into  her  good-morning  routine  like  there  was</p>
      <p>nothing different about her, figuring the patients’ll be too sleepy to notice.</p>
      <p>“Good morning, Mr. Sefelt, are your teeth any better? Good morning, Mr. Fredrickson, did you</p>
      <p>and  Mr.  Sefelt  have  a  good  night  last  night?  You  bed  right  next  to  each  other,  don’t  you?</p>
      <p>Incidentally, it’s been brought to my attention that you two have made some arrangement with your</p>
      <p>medication—you are letting Bruce have your medication, aren’t you, Mr. Sefelt? We’ll discuss that</p>
      <p>later. Good morning, Billy; I saw your mother on the way in, and she told me to be sure to tell you</p>
      <p>she  thought  of  you  all  the  time  and  knew  you  wouldn’t  disappoint  her.  Good  morning,  Mr.</p>
      <p>Harding—why,  look,  your  fingertips  are  red  and  raw.  Have  you  been  chewing  your  fingernails</p>
      <p>again?”</p>
      <p>Before they could answer, even if there was some answer to make, she turns to McMurphy still</p>
      <p>standing there in his shorts. Harding looks at the shorts and whistles.</p>
      <p>[91] “And you, Mr. McMurphy,” she says, smiling, sweet as sugar, “if you are finished showing</p>
      <p>off your manly physique and your gaudy underpants, I think you had better go back in the dorm and</p>
      <p>put on your greens.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>57</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>He tips his cap to her and to the patients ogling and poking fun at his white-whale shorts, and</p>
      <p>goes to the dorm without a word. She turns and starts off in the other direction, her flat red smile</p>
      <p>going out before her; before she’s got the door closed on her glass station, his singing is rolling from</p>
      <p>the dorm door into the hall again.</p>
      <p>“ ‘She took me to her parlor, and coo-oo-ooled me with her fan’ ”—I can hear the whack as he</p>
      <p>slaps his bare belly—“ ‘whispered low in her mamma’s ear, I luh-uhvvv that gamblin’ man.’ ”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>Sweeping  the  dorm  soon’s  it’s empty,  I’m  after  dust  mice  under his  bed  when  I  get  a  smell  of</p>
      <p>something that makes me realize for the first time since I been in the hospital that this big dorm full</p>
      <p>of  beds,  sleeps  forty  grown  men,  has  always  been  sticky  with  a  thousand  other  smells—smells  of</p>
      <p>germicide, zinc ointment, and foot powder, smell of piss and sour old-man manure, of Pablum and</p>
      <p>eyewash, of musty shorts and socks musty even when they’re fresh back from the laundry, the stiff</p>
      <p>odor of starch in the linen, the acid stench of morning mouths, the banana smell of machine oil, and</p>
      <p>sometimes  the  smell  of  singed  hair—but  never  before  now,  before  he  came  in,  the  man  smell  of</p>
      <p>dust and dirt from the open fields, and sweat, and work.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>58</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>9</p>
      <p>All through breakfast McMurphy’s talking and laughing a mile a minute. After this morning he</p>
      <p>thinks  the  Big  Nurse  is  going  to  be  a  snap.  He  don’t  know  he  just  caught  her  off  guard  and,  if</p>
      <p>anything, made her strengthen herself.</p>
      <p>He’s being the clown, working at getting some of the guys to laugh. It bothers him that the best</p>
      <p>they can do is grin weakly and snigger sometimes. He prods at Billy Bibbit, sitting across the table</p>
      <p>from  him,  says  in  a  secret  voice,  “Hey,  Billy  boy,  you  remember  that  time  in  Seattle  you  and  me</p>
      <p>picked up those two twitches? One of the best rolls I ever had.”</p>
      <p>Billy’s eyes bob up from his plate. He opens his mouth but can’t say a thing. McMurphy turns to</p>
      <p>Harding.</p>
      <p>“We’d never have brought it off, neither, picking them up on the spur of the moment that way,</p>
      <p>except that they’d heard tell of Billy Bibbit. Billy ‘Club’ Bibbit, he was known as in them days. Those</p>
      <p>girls  were  about  to  take  off  when  one  looked  at  him  and  says  ‘Are  you  the  renowned  Billy  Club</p>
      <p>Bibbit?  Of  the  famous  fourteen  inches?’  And  Billy  ducked  his  head  and  blushed—like  he’s  doin’</p>
      <p>now—and we were a shoo-in. And I remember, when we got them up to the hotel, there was this</p>
      <p>woman’s voice from over near Billy’s bed, says, ‘Mister Bibbit, I’m disappointed in you; I heard that</p>
      <p>you had four—four—for goodness sakes!’ ”</p>
      <p>And whoops and slaps his leg and gooses Billy with his thumb till I think Billy will fall in a dead</p>
      <p>faint from blushing and grinning.</p>
      <p>McMurphy says that as a matter of fact a couple of sweet twitches like those two is the only thing</p>
      <p>this hospital does lack. The bed they give a man here, finest he’s ever slept in, and what a fine table</p>
      <p>they do spread. He can’t figure why everybody’s so glum about being locked up here.</p>
      <p>“Look at me now,” he tells the guys and lifts a glass to the light, “getting my first glass of orange</p>
      <p>juice in six months. Hooee, that’s good. I ask you, what did I get for breakfast at that work farm?</p>
      <p>What was I served? Well, I can describe what it looked like, but I sure couldn’t hang a name on it;</p>
      <p>morning noon and night it was burnt black and had potatoes in it and [93] looked like roofing glue. I</p>
      <p>know one thing; it wasn’t orange juice. Look at me now: bacon, toast, butter, eggs—coffee the little</p>
      <p>honey in the kitchen even asks me if I like it black or white thank you—and a great! big! cold glass</p>
      <p>of orange juice. Why, you couldn’t pay me to leave this place!”</p>
      <p>He  gets  seconds  on  everything  and  makes  a  date  with  the  girl  pours  coffee  in  the  kitchen  for</p>
      <p>when he gets discharged, and he compliments the Negro cook on sunnysiding the best eggs he ever</p>
      <p>ate. There’s bananas for the corn flakes, and he gets a handful, tells the black boy that he’ll filch him</p>
      <p>one ‘cause he looks so starved, and the black boy shifts his eyes to look down the hall to where the</p>
      <p>nurse is sitting in her glass case, and says it ain’t allowed for the help to eat with the patients.</p>
      <p>“Against ward policy?”</p>
      <p>“Tha’s right.”</p>
      <p>“Tough luck”—and peels three bananas right under the black boy’s nose and eats one after the</p>
      <p>other, tells the boy that any time you want one snuck outa the mess hall for you, Sam, you just give</p>
      <p>the word.</p>
      <p>When McMurphy finishes his last banana he slaps his belly and gets up and heads for the door,</p>
      <p>and the big black boy blocks the door and tells him the rule that patients sit in the mess hall till they</p>
      <p>all leave at seven-thirty. McMurphy stares at him like he can’t believe he’s hearing right, then turns</p>
      <p>and looks at Harding. Harding nods his head, so McMurphy shrugs and goes back to his chair. “I</p>
      <p>sure don’t want to go against that goddamned policy.”</p>
      <p>The  clock  at the  end of  the mess  hall  shows  it’s  a  quarter  after  seven,  lies  about how  we  only</p>
      <p>been sitting here fifteen minutes when you can tell it’s been at least an hour. Everybody is finished</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>59</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>eating and leaned back, watching the big hand to move to seven-thirty. The black boys take away the</p>
      <p>Vegetables’  splattered  trays  and  wheel  the  two  old  men  down  to  get  hosed  off.  In  the  mess  hall</p>
      <p>about half the guys lay their heads on their arms, figuring to get a little sleep before the black boys</p>
      <p>get  back.  There’s nothing  else  to  do,  with no  cards  or magazines  or  picture puzzles.  Just  sleep  or</p>
      <p>watch the clock.</p>
      <p>But McMurphy can’t keep still for that; he’s got to be up to something. After about two minutes</p>
      <p>of pushing food scraps around his plate with his spoon, he’s ready for more excitement. He hooks</p>
      <p>his thumbs in his pockets and tips back and one-eyes that clock up on the wall. Then he rubs his</p>
      <p>nose.</p>
      <p>“You  know—that old  clock  up  there  puts me  in mind  of the targets  at the target range  at  Fort</p>
      <p>Riley.  That’s  where  I  got  my  first  medal,  a  sharpshooter  medal.  Dead-Eye  McMurphy.  [94]  Who</p>
      <p>wants to lay me a pore little dollar that I can’t put this dab of butter square in the center of the face</p>
      <p>of that clock up there, or at least on the face?”</p>
      <p>He gets three bets and takes up his butter pat and puts it on his knife, gives it a flip. It sticks a</p>
      <p>good six inches or so to the left of the clock, and everybody kids him about it until he pays his bets.</p>
      <p>They’re still riding him about did he mean Dead-Eye or Dead-Eyes when the least black boy gets</p>
      <p>back  from  hosing  Vegetables  and  everybody  looks  into  his  plate  and  keeps  quiet.  The  black  boy</p>
      <p>senses something is in the air, but he can’t see what. And he probably never would of known except</p>
      <p>old Colonel Matterson is gazing around, and he sees the butter stuck up on the wall and this causes</p>
      <p>him  to  point  up  at  it  and  go  into  one  of  his  lessons,  explaining  to  us  all  in  his  patient,  rumbling</p>
      <p>voice, just like what he said made sense.</p>
      <p>“The but-ter ... is the Re-pub-li-can party. ...”</p>
      <p>The black boy looks where the colonel is pointing, and there that butter is, easing down the wall</p>
      <p>like a yellow snail. He blinks at it but he doesn’t say a word, doesn’t even bother looking around to</p>
      <p>make certain who flipped it up there.</p>
      <p>McMurphy  is  whispering  and  nudging  the  Acutes  sitting  around  him,  and  in  a  minute  they  all</p>
      <p>nod, and he lays three dollars on the table and leans back. Everybody turns in his chair and watches</p>
      <p>that butter sneak on down the wall, starting, hanging still, shooting ahead and leaving a shiny trail</p>
      <p>behind it on the paint. Nobody says a word. They look at the butter, then at the clock, then back at</p>
      <p>the butter. The clock’s moving now.</p>
      <p>The butter makes it down to the floor about a half a minute before seven-thirty, and McMurphy</p>
      <p>gets back all the money he lost.</p>
      <p>The black boy wakes up and turns away from the greasy stripe on the wall and says we can go,</p>
      <p>and McMurphy walks out of the mess hall, folding his money in his pocket. He puts his arms around</p>
      <p>the black boy’s shoulders and half walks, half carries him, down the hall toward the day room. “The</p>
      <p>day’s  half  gone,  Sam,  of  buddy,  an’  I’m  just  barely  breaking  even.  I’ll  have  to  hustle  to  catch  up.</p>
      <p>How about breaking out that deck of cards you got locked securely in that cabinet, and I’ll see if I</p>
      <p>can make myself heard over that loudspeaker.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>Spends most of that morning hustling to catch up by dealing more blackjack, playing for IOUs</p>
      <p>now  instead  of  cigarettes.  He  moves  the  blackjack  table  two  or  three  times  to  try  to  get  [95]  out</p>
      <p>from under the speaker. You can tell it’s getting on his nerves. Finally he goes to the Nurses’ Station</p>
      <p>and raps on a pane of glass till the Big Nurse swivels in her chair and opens the door, and he asks</p>
      <p>her how about turning that infernal noise off for a while. She’s calmer than ever now, back in her</p>
      <p>seat behind her pane of glass; there’s no heathen running around half-naked to unbalance her. Her</p>
      <p>smile  is  settled  and  solid.  She  closes  her  eyes  and  shakes  her  head  and  tells  McMurphy  very</p>
      <p>pleasantly, No.</p>
      <empty-line/>

      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Can’t you even ease down on the volume? It ain’t like the whole state of Oregon needed to hear</p>
      <p>Lawrence Welk play ‘Tea for Two’ three times every hour, all day long! If it was soft enough to hear</p>
      <p>a man shout his bets across the table I might get a game of poker going—”</p>
      <p>“You’ve been told, Mr. McMurphy, that it’s against the policy to gamble for money on the ward.”</p>
      <p>“Okay, then down soft enough to gamble for matches, for fly buttons—just turn the damn thing</p>
      <p>down!”</p>
      <p>“Mr.  McMurphy”—she  waits  and  lets  her  calm  schoolteacher tone  sink  in  before  she  goes  on;</p>
      <p>she  knows  every  Acute  on the  ward  is  listening  to  them—”do  you  want  to  know  what  I think?  I</p>
      <p>think  you  are  being  very  selfish.  Haven’t  you  noticed  there  are  others  in  this  hospital  besides</p>
      <p>yourself? There are old men here who couldn’t hear the radio at all if it were lower, old fellows who</p>
      <p>simply aren’t capable of reading, or working puzzles—or playing cards to win other men’s cigarettes.</p>
      <p>Old  fellows  like  Matterson  and  Kittling,  that music  coming  from the  loudspeaker  is  all  they have.</p>
      <p>And you want to take that away from them. We like to hear suggestions and requests whenever we</p>
      <p>can,  but  I  should  think  you  might  at  least  give  some  thought  to  others  before  you  make  your</p>
      <p>requests.”</p>
      <p>He  turns  and  looks  over  at  the  Chronic  side  and  sees  there’s  something  to  what  she  says.  He</p>
      <p>takes off his cap and runs his hand in his hair, finally turns back to her. He knows as well as she</p>
      <p>does that all the Acutes are listening to everything they say.</p>
      <p>“Okay—I never thought about that.”</p>
      <p>“I thought you hadn’t.”</p>
      <p>He tugs at that little tuft of red showing out of the neck of his greens, then says. “Well, hey; what</p>
      <p>do you say to us taking the card game someplace else? Some other room? Like, say, that room you</p>
      <p>people put the tables in during that meeting. There’s nothing in there all the rest of the day. You</p>
      <p>could unlock that room and let the card-players go in there, and leave [96] the old men out here with</p>
      <p>their radio—a good deal all around.”</p>
      <p>She smiles and closes her eyes again and shakes her head gently. “Of course, you may take the</p>
      <p>suggestion  up  with  the  rest  of  the  staff  at  some  time,  but  I’m  afraid  everyone’s  feelings  will</p>
      <p>correspond  with  mine:  we  do not have  adequate  coverage  for  two  day  rooms.  There  isn’t  enough</p>
      <p>personnel.  And  I  wish  you  wouldn’t  lean  against  the  glass  there,  please;  your  hands  are  oily  and</p>
      <p>staining the window. That means extra work for some of the other men.”</p>
      <p>He jerks his hand away, and I see he starts to say something and then stops, realizing she didn’t</p>
      <p>leave him anything else to say, unless he wants to start cussing at her. His face and neck are red. He</p>
      <p>draws a long breath and concentrates on his will power, the way she did this morning, and tells her</p>
      <p>that he is very sorry to have bothered her, and goes back to the card table.</p>
      <p>Everybody on the ward can feel that it’s started.</p>
      <p>At eleven o’clock the doctor comes to the day-room door and calls over to McMurphy that he’d</p>
      <p>like to have him come down to his office for an interview. “I interview all new admissions on the</p>
      <p>second day.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy lays down his cards and stands up and walks over to the doctor. The doctor asks him</p>
      <p>how his night was, but McMurphy just mumbles an answer.</p>
      <p>“You look deep in thought today, Mr. McMurphy.”</p>
      <p>“Oh, I’m a thinker all right,” McMurphy says, and they walk off together down the hall. When</p>
      <p>they  come  back  what  seems  like  days  later,  they’re  both  grinning  and  talking  and  happy  about</p>
      <p>something. The doctor is wiping tears off his glasses and looks like he’s actually been laughing, and</p>
      <p>McMurphy is back as loud and full of brass and swagger as ever. He’s that way all through lunch,</p>
      <p>and at one o’clock he’s the first one in his seat for the meeting, his eyes blue and ornery from his</p>
      <p>place in the corner.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>61</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>The  Big  Nurse  comes  into  the  day  room  with  her  covey  of  student  nurses  and  her  basket  of</p>
      <p>notes. She picks the log book up from the table and frowns into it a minute (nobody’s informed on</p>
      <p>anybody  all  day  long),  then  goes to  her  seat  beside  the  door.  She picks  up  some  folders  from the</p>
      <p>basket on her lap and riffles through them till she finds the one on Harding.</p>
      <p>“As I recall, we were making quite a bit of headway yesterday with Mr. Harding’s problem—”</p>
      <p>“Ah—before  we  go  into  that,”  the  doctor  says,  “I’d  like  to  interrupt  a  moment,  if  I  might.</p>
      <p>Concerning a talk Mr. [97] McMurphy and I had in my office this morning. Reminiscing, actually.</p>
      <p>Talking  over  old  times.  You  see  Mr.  McMurphy  and  I  find  we  have  something  in  common—we</p>
      <p>went to the same high school.”</p>
      <p>The  nurses  look  at  one  another  and  wonder  what’s  got  into  this  man.  The  patients  glance  at</p>
      <p>McMurphy grinning from his corner and wait for the doctor to go on. He nods his head.</p>
      <p>“Yes, the same high school. And in the course of our reminiscing we happened to bring up the</p>
      <p>carnivals  the  school  used  to  sponsor—marvelous,  noisy,  gala  occasions.  Decorations,  crepe</p>
      <p>streamers, booths, games—it was always one of the prime events of the year. I—as I mentioned to</p>
      <p>McMurphy—was  the  chairman  of  the  high-school  carnival  both  my  junior  and  senior  years—</p>
      <p>wonderful carefree years ...”</p>
      <p>It’s got real quiet in the day room. The doctor raises his head, peers around to see if he’s making</p>
      <p>a fool of himself. The Big Nurse is giving him a look that shouldn’t leave any doubts about it, but he</p>
      <p>doesn’t have on his glasses and the look misses him.</p>
      <p>“Anyway—to put an end to this maudlin display of nostalgia—in the course of our conversation</p>
      <p>McMurphy and I wondered what would be the attitude of some of the men toward a carnival here</p>
      <p>on the ward?”</p>
      <p>He puts on his glasses and peers around again. Nobody’s jumping up and down at the idea. Some</p>
      <p>of us can remember Taber trying to engineer a carnival a few years back, and what happened to it.</p>
      <p>As  the  doctor  waits,  a  silence  rears  up  from  out  of  the  nurse  and  looms  over  everybody,  daring</p>
      <p>anybody to challenge it. I know McMurphy can’t because he was in on the planning of the carnival,</p>
      <p>and just as I’m thinking that nobody will be fool enough to break that silence, Cheswick, who sits</p>
      <p>right  next to  McMurphy,  gives  a  grunt  and  is  on his  feet,  rubbing  his  ribs,  before  he  knows  what</p>
      <p>happened.</p>
      <p>“Uh—I  personally  believe,  see”—he  looks  down  at  McMurphy’s  fist  on  the  chair  arm  beside</p>
      <p>him, with that big stiff thumb sticking straight up out of it like a cow prod—“that a carnival is a real</p>
      <p>good idea. Something to break the monotony.”</p>
      <p>“That’s  right,  Charley,”  the  doctor  says,  appreciating  Cheswick’s  support,  “and  not  altogether</p>
      <p>without therapeutic value.”</p>
      <p>“Certainly  not,”  Cheswick  says,  looking  happier  now.  “No.  Lots  of  therapeutics  in  a  carnival.</p>
      <p>You bet.”</p>
      <p>“It would b-b-be fun,” Billy Bibbit says.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, that too,” Cheswick says. “We could do it, Doctor Spivey, sure we could. Scanlon can do</p>
      <p>his human bomb act, and I can make a ring toss in Occupational Therapy.”</p>
      <p>[98] “I’ll tell fortunes,” Martini says and squints at a spot above his head.</p>
      <p>“I’m rather good at diagnosing pathologies from palm reading, myself,” Harding says.</p>
      <p>“Good, good,” Cheswick says and claps his hands. He’s never had anybody support anything he</p>
      <p>said before.</p>
      <p>“Myself,” McMurphy drawls, “I’d be honored to work a skillo wheel. Had a little experience ...”</p>
      <p>“Oh, there are numerous possibilities,” the doctor says, sitting up straight in his chair and really</p>
      <p>warming to it. “Why, I’ve got a million ideas ...”</p>
      <p>He talks full steam ahead for another five minutes. You can tell a lot of the ideas are ideas he’s</p>
      <p>already talked over with McMurphy. He describes games, booths, talks of selling tickets, then stops</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>62</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>as  suddenly  as  though  the  Nurse’s  look  had  hit  him  right  between  the  eyes.  He blinks  at  her  and</p>
      <p>asks, “What do you think of the idea, Miss Ratched? Of a carnival? Here, on the ward?”</p>
      <p>“I agree that it may have a number of therapeutic possibilities,” she says, and waits. She lets that</p>
      <p>silence rear up from her again. When she’s sure nobody’s going to challenge it, she goes on. “But I</p>
      <p>also believe that an idea like this should be discussed in staff meeting before a decision is reached.</p>
      <p>Wasn’t that your idea, Doctor?”</p>
      <p>“Of course. I merely thought, understand, I would feel out some of the men first. But certainly, a</p>
      <p>staff meeting first. Then we’ll continue our plans.”</p>
      <p>Everybody knows that’s all there is to the carnival.</p>
      <p>The  Big  Nurse  starts  to  bring  things  back  into  hand  by  rattling  the  folio  she’s  holding.  “Fine.</p>
      <p>Then if there is no other new business—and if Mr. Cheswick will be seated—I think we might go</p>
      <p>right  on  into  the  discussion.  We  have”—she  takes  her  watch  from  the  basket  and  looks  at  it—</p>
      <p>“forty-eight minutes left. So, as I—”</p>
      <p>“Oh.  Hey,  wait.  I  remember  there  is  some  other  new  business.”  McMurphy  has  his  hand  up,</p>
      <p>fingers snapping. She looks at the hand for a long time before she says anything.</p>
      <p>“Yes, Mr. McMurphy?”</p>
      <p>“Not  me,  Doctor  Spivey  has.  Doc,  tell  ‘em  what  you  come  up  with  about  the  hard-of-hearing</p>
      <p>guys and the radio.”</p>
      <p>The nurse’s head gives one little jerk, barely enough to see, but my heart is suddenly roaring. She</p>
      <p>puts the folio back in the basket, turns to the doctor.</p>
      <p>“Yes,”  says  the  doctor.  “I  very  nearly  forgot.”  He leans  back  and  crosses  his  legs  and  puts  his</p>
      <p>fingertips together; I can see [99] he’s still in good spirits about his carnival. “You see, McMurphy</p>
      <p>and  I  were  talking  about  that  age-old  problem  we  have  on  this  ward:  the  mixed  population,  the</p>
      <p>young and the old together. It’s not the most ideal surroundings for our Therapeutic Community,</p>
      <p>but Administration says there’s no helping it with the Geriatric Building overloaded the way it is. I’ll</p>
      <p>be  the  first  to  admit  it’s  not  an  absolutely  pleasant  situation  for  anyone  concerned.  In  our  talk,</p>
      <p>however,  McMurphy  and  I  did  happen  to  come  up  with  an  idea  which  might  make  things  more</p>
      <p>pleasant  for  both  age  groups.  McMurphy  mentioned  that  he  had  noticed  some  of  the  old  fellows</p>
      <p>seemed to have difficulty hearing the radio. He suggested the speaker might be turned up louder so</p>
      <p>the Chronics with auditory weaknesses could hear it. A very humane suggestion, I think.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy gives a modest wave of his hand, and the doctor nods at him and goes on.</p>
      <p>“But I told him I had received previous complaints from some of the younger men that the radio</p>
      <p>is already so loud it hinders conversation and reading. McMurphy said he hadn’t thought of this, but</p>
      <p>mentioned that it did seem a shame that those who wished to read couldn’t get off by themselves</p>
      <p>where it was quiet and leave the radio for those who wished to listen. I agreed with him that it did</p>
      <p>seem  a  shame  and  was  ready  to  drop  the  matter  when  I  happened  to  think  of  the  old  tub  room</p>
      <p>where we store the tables during the ward meeting. We don’t use the room at all otherwise; there’s</p>
      <p>no longer a need for the hydrotherapy it was designed for, now that we have the new drugs. So how</p>
      <p>would the group like to have that room as a sort of second day room, a game room, shall we say?”</p>
      <p>The group isn’t saying. They know whose play it is next. She folds Harding’s folio back up and</p>
      <p>puts it on her lap and crosses her hands over it, looking around the room just like somebody might</p>
      <p>dare have something to say. When it’s clear nobody’s going to talk till she does, her head turns again</p>
      <p>to the doctor. “It sounds like a fine plan, Doctor Spivey, and I appreciate Mr. McMurphy’s interest</p>
      <p>in  the  other  patients,  but  I’m  terribly  afraid  we  don’t  have  the  personnel  to  cover  a  second  day</p>
      <p>room.”</p>
      <p>And  is  so  certain  that  this  should  be  the  end  of  it  she  starts  to  open  the  folio  again.  But  the</p>
      <p>doctor has thought this through more than she figured.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>63</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“I thought of that too, Miss Ratched. But since it will be largely the Chronic patients who remain</p>
      <p>here in the day room with the speaker—most of whom are restricted to lounges or wheel chairs—</p>
      <p>one aide and one nurse in here should easily be [100] able to put down any riots or uprisings that</p>
      <p>might occur, don’t you think?”</p>
      <p>She doesn’t answer, and she doesn’t care much for his joking about riots and uprisings either, but</p>
      <p>her face doesn’t change. The smile stays.</p>
      <p>“So the other two aides and nurses can cover the men in the tub room, perhaps even better than</p>
      <p>here in a larger area. What do you think, men? Is it a workable idea? I’m rather enthused about it</p>
      <p>myself, and I say we give it a try, see what it’s like for a few days. If it doesn’t work, well, we’ve still</p>
      <p>got the key to lock it back up, haven’t we?”</p>
      <p>“Right!” Cheswick says, socks his fist into his palm. He’s still standing, like he’s afraid to get near</p>
      <p>that thumb of McMurphy’s again. “Right, Doctor Spivey, if it don’t work, we’ve still got the key to</p>
      <p>lock it back up. You bet.”</p>
      <p>The doctor looks around the room and sees all the other Acutes nodding and smiling and looking</p>
      <p>so  pleased  with  what  he  takes  to  be him  and  his  idea  that  he blushes  like  Billy  Bibbit  and  has  to</p>
      <p>polish his glasses a time or two before he can go on. It tickles me to see the little man so happy with</p>
      <p>himself.  He  looks  at  all  the  guys  nodding,  and nods  himself  and  says,  “Fine,  fine,”  and  settles his</p>
      <p>hands on his knees. “Very good. Now. If that’s decided—I seem to have forgotten what we were</p>
      <p>planning to talk about this morning?”</p>
      <p>The nurse’s head gives that one little jerk again, and she bends over her basket, picks up a folio.</p>
      <p>She  fumbles  with  the papers,  and  it  looks  like  her  hands  are  shaking.  She  draws  out  a  paper,  but</p>
      <p>once more, before she can start reading out of-it, McMurphy is standing and holding up his hand</p>
      <p>and shifting from foot to foot, giving a long, thoughtful, “Saaaay,” and her fumbling stops, freezes</p>
      <p>as though the sound of his voice froze her just like her voice froze that black boy this morning. I get</p>
      <p>that giddy feeling inside me again when she freezes. I watch her close while McMurphy talks.</p>
      <p>“Saaaaay,  Doctor,  what  I  been  dyin’  to  know  is  what  did  this  dream  I  dreamt  the  other  night</p>
      <p>mean? You see, it was like I was me, in the dream, and then again kind of like I wasn’t me—like I was</p>
      <p>somebody else that looked like me—like—like my daddy! Yeah, that’s who it was. It was my daddy</p>
      <p>because sometimes when I saw me—him—I saw there was this iron bolt through the jawbone like</p>
      <p>daddy used to have—”</p>
      <p>“Your father has an iron bolt through his jawbone?”</p>
      <p>“Well, not any more, but he did once when I was a kid. He went around for about ten months</p>
      <p>with this big metal bolt going in here and coming out here! God, he was a regular [101] Frankenstein.</p>
      <p>He’d been clipped on the jaw with a pole ax when he got into some kinda hassle with this pond man</p>
      <p>at the logging mill—Hey! Let me tell you how that incident came about. …”</p>
      <p>Her  face  is  still  calm,  as  though  sbe  had  a  cast  made  and  painted  to  just  the  look  she  wants.</p>
      <p>Confident,  patient,  and  unruffled.  No  more  little  jerk,  just  that  terrible  cold  face,  a  calm  smile</p>
      <p>stamped out of red plastic; a clean, smooth forehead, not a line in it to show weakness or worry; flat,</p>
      <p>wide, painted-on green eyes, painted on with an expression that says I can wait, I might lose a yard</p>
      <p>now and then but I can wait, and be patient and calm and confident, because I know there’s no real</p>
      <p>losing for me.</p>
      <p>I thought for a minute there I saw her whipped. Maybe I did. But I see now that it don’t make</p>
      <p>any difference. One by one the patients are sneaking looks at her to see how she’s taking the way</p>
      <p>McMurphy is dominating the meeting, and they see the same thing. She’s too big to be beaten. She</p>
      <p>covers one whole side of the room like a Jap statue. There’s no moving her and no help against her.</p>
      <p>She’s lost a little battle here today, but it’s a minor battle in a big war that she’s been winning and</p>
      <p>that  she’ll  go  on  winning.  We  mustn’t  let  McMurphy  get  our  hopes  up  any  different,  lure  us  into</p>
      <p>making some kind of dumb play. She’ll go on winning, just like the Combine, because she has all the</p>

      <p>64</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>power of the Combine behind her. She don’t lose on her losses, but she wins on ours. To beat her</p>
      <p>you don’t have to whip her two out of three or three out of five, but every time you meet. As soon</p>
      <p>as you let down your guard, as soon as you lose once, she’s won for good. And eventually we all got</p>
      <p>to lose. Nobody can help that.</p>
      <p>Right now, she’s got the fog machine switched on, and it’s rolling in so fast I can’t see a thing but</p>
      <p>her face, rolling in thicker and thicker, and I feel as hopeless and dead as I felt happy a minute ago,</p>
      <p>when  she  gave  that  little  jerk—even  more  hopeless  than  ever  before, on  account  of  I  know  now</p>
      <p>there  is  no  real  help  against  her  or  her  Combine.  McMurphy  can’t  help  any  more  than  I  could.</p>
      <p>Nobody can help. And the more I think about how nothing can be helped, the faster the fog rolls in.</p>
      <p>And I’m glad when it gets thick enough you’re lost in it and can let go, and be safe again.</p>

      <p>There’s a Monopoly game going on in the day room. They’ve been at it for three days, houses</p>
      <p>and hotels everywhere, two tables pushed together to take care of all the deeds and stacks of play</p>
      <p>money. McMurphy talked them into making the game interesting by paying a penny for every play</p>
      <p>dollar the bank issues them; the monopoly box is loaded with change.</p>
      <p>“It’s your roll, Cheswick.”</p>
      <p>“Hold it a minute before he rolls. What’s a man need to buy thum hotels?”</p>
      <p>“You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let’s go, for Christsakes.”</p>
      <p>“Hold it a minute.”</p>
      <p>There’s a flurry of money from that side of the table, red and green and yellow bills blowing in</p>
      <p>every direction.</p>
      <p>“You buying a hotel or you playing happy new year, for Christsakes?”</p>
      <p>“It’s your dirty roll, Cheswick.”</p>
      <p>“Snake eyes! Hoooeee, Cheswicker, where does that put you? That don’t put you on my Marvin</p>
      <p>Gardens  by  any  chance?  That  don’t  mean  you  have  to  pay  me,  let’s  see,  three  hundred  and  fifty</p>
      <p>dollars?”</p>
      <p>“Boogered.”</p>
      <p>“What’s thum other things? Hold it a minute. What’s thum other things all over the board?”</p>
      <p>“Martini,  you  been  seeing  them  other  things  all  over  the  board  for  two  days.  No  wonder  I’m</p>
      <p>losing  my  ass.  McMurphy,  I  don’t  see  how  you  can  concentrate  with  Martini  sitting  there</p>
      <p>hallucinating a mile a minute.”</p>
      <p>“Cheswick,  you  never  mind  about  Martini.  He’s  doing  real  good.  You  just  come  on  with  that</p>
      <p>three fifty, and Martini will take care of himself; don’t we get rent from him every time one of his</p>
      <p>‘things’ lands on our property?”</p>
      <p>“Hold it a minute. There’s so many of thum.”</p>
      <p>“That’s okay, Mart. You just keep us posted whose property they land on. You’re still the man</p>
      <p>with the dice, Cheswick. You rolled a double, so you roll again. Atta boy. Faw! a big six.”</p>
      <p>[103]  “Takes  me  to  ...  Chance:  ‘You  Have  Been  Elected  Chairman  of  the  Board;  Pay  Every</p>
      <p>Player—’ Boogered and double boogered!”</p>
      <p>“Whose hotel is this here for Christsakes on the Reading Railroad?”</p>
      <p>“My friend, that, as anyone can see, is not a hotel; it’s a depot.”</p>
      <p>“Now hold it a minute—”</p>
      <p>McMurphy  surrounds  his  end  of  the  table,  moving  cards,  rearranging  money,  evening  up  his</p>
      <p>hotels.  There’s  a  hundred.  dollar  bill  sticking  out  of  the  brim  of  his  cap  like  a  press  card;  mad</p>
      <p>money, he calls it.</p>
      <p>“Scanlon? I believe it’s your turn, buddy.”</p>
      <p>“Gimme those dice. I’ll blow this board to pieces. Here we go. Lebenty Leben, count me over</p>
      <p>eleven, Martini.”</p>
      <p>“Why, all right.”</p>
      <p>“Not that one, you crazy bastard; that’s not my piece, that’s my house.”</p>
      <p>“It’s the same color.”</p>
      <p>“What’s this little house doing on the Electric Company?”</p>
      <p>“That’s a power station.”</p>
      <p>“Martini, those ain’t the dice you’re shaking—”</p>
      <p>“Let him be; what’s the difference?”</p>
      <p>“Those are a couple of houses!”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>66</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Faw.  And  Martini  rolls  a  big,  let  me  see,  a  big  nineteen.  Good  goin’,  Mart;  that  puts  you—</p>
      <p>Where’s your piece, buddy?”</p>
      <p>“Eh? Why here it is.”</p>
      <p>“He  had  it  in  his  mouth,  McMurphy.  Excellent.  That’s  two  moves  over  the  second  and  third</p>
      <p>bicuspid,  four  moves  to  the board,  which  takes  you  on  to—to Baltic  Avenue,  Martini.  Your  own</p>
      <p>and only property. How fortunate can a man get, friends? Martini has been playing three days and lit</p>
      <p>on his property practically every time.”</p>
      <p>“Shut up and roll, Harding. It’s your turn.”</p>
      <p>Harding gathers the dice up with his long fingers, feeling the smooth surfaces with his thumb as</p>
      <p>if he was blind. The fingers are the same color as the dice and look like they were carved by his other</p>
      <p>hand. The dice rattle in his hand as he shakes it. They tumble to a stop in front of McMurphy.</p>
      <p>“Faw. Five, six, seven. Tough luck, buddy. That’s another o’ my vast holdin’s. You owe me—oh,</p>
      <p>two hundred dollars should about cover it.”</p>
      <p>Pity.</p>
      <p>The game goes round and round, to the rattle of dice and the shuffle of play money.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>67</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>11</p>
      <p>There’s long spells—three days, years—when you can’t see a thing, know where you are only by</p>
      <p>the  speaker  sounding  overhead  like  a  bell  buoy  clanging  in  the  fog.  When  I  can  see, the  guys  are</p>
      <p>usually moving around as unconcerned as though they didn’t notice so much as a mist in the air. I</p>
      <p>believe the fog affects their memory some way it doesn’t affect mine.</p>
      <p>Even McMurphy doesn’t seem to know he’s been fogged in. If he does, he makes sure not to let</p>
      <p>on that he’s bothered by it. He’s making sure none of the staff sees him bothered by anything; he</p>
      <p>knows that there’s no better way in the world to aggravate somebody who’s trying to make it hard</p>
      <p>for you than by acting like you’re not bothered.</p>
      <p>He  keeps  up  his  high-class  manners  around  the nurses  and the  black  boys  in  spite of  anything</p>
      <p>they might say to him, in spite of every trick they pull to get him to lose his temper. A couple of</p>
      <p>times some stupid rule gets him mad, but he just makes himself act more polite and mannerly than</p>
      <p>ever till he begins to see how funny the whole thing is—the rules, the disapproving looks they use to</p>
      <p>enforce the rules, the ways of talking to you like you’re nothing but a three-year-old—and when he</p>
      <p>sees how funny it is he goes to laughing, and this aggravates them no end. He’s safe as long as he</p>
      <p>can laugh, he thinks, and it works pretty fair. Just once he loses control and shows he’s mad, and</p>
      <p>then it’s not because of the black boys or the Big Nurse and something they did, but it’s because of</p>
      <p>the patients, and something they didn’t do.</p>
      <p>It  happened  at  one  of  the  group  meetings.  He  got  mad  at  the  guys  for  acting  too  cagey—too</p>
      <p>chicken-shit, he  called  it.  He’d  been  taking  bets  from  all  of  them  on  the  World  Series  coming  up</p>
      <p>Friday. He’d had it in mind that they would get to watch the games on TV, even though they didn’t</p>
      <p>come on during regulation TV time. During the meeting a few days before he asks if it wouldn’t be</p>
      <p>okay  if  they  did  the  cleaning  work  at  night,  during  TV  time,  and  watched  the  games  during  the</p>
      <p>afternoon. The nurse tells him no, which is about what he expected. She tells him how the schedule</p>
      <p>has  been  set  up  for  a  [105]  delicately  balanced  reason  that  would  be  thrown  into  turmoil  by  the</p>
      <p>switch of routines.</p>
      <p>This doesn’t surprise him, coming from the nurse; what does surprise him is how the Acutes act</p>
      <p>when he asks them what they think of the idea. Nobody says a thing. They’re all sunk back out of</p>
      <p>sight in little pockets of fog. I can barely see them.</p>
      <p>“Now  look  here,”  he  tells  them,  but  they  don’t  look.  He’s  been  waiting  for  somebody  to  say</p>
      <p>something,  answer  his  question.  Nobody  acts  like  they’ve  heard  it.  “Look  here,  damn  it,”  he  says</p>
      <p>when  nobody  moves,  “there’s  at  least  twelve  of  you  guys  I  know  of  myself  got  a  leetle  personal</p>
      <p>interest who wins these games. Don’t you guys care to watch them?”</p>
      <p>“I don’t know, Mack,” Scanlon finally says, “I’m pretty used to seeing that six-o’clock news. And</p>
      <p>if switching times would really mess up the schedule as bad as Miss Ratched says—”</p>
      <p>“The hell with the schedule. You can get back to the bloody schedule next week, when the Series</p>
      <p>is over. What do you say, buddies? Let’s take a vote on watching the TV during the afternoon instead</p>
      <p>of at night. All those in favor?”</p>
      <p>“Ay,” Cheswick calls out and gets to his feet.</p>
      <p>“I mean all those in favor raise their hands. Okay, all those in favor?”</p>
      <p>Cheswick’s hand comes up. Some of the other guys look around to see if there’s any other fools.</p>
      <p>McMurphy can’t believe it.</p>
      <p>“Come on now, what is this crap? I thought you guys could vote on policy and that sort of thing.</p>
      <p>Isn’t that the way it is, Doc?”</p>
      <p>The doctor nods without looking up.</p>
      <p>“Okay then; now who wants to watch those games?”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>68</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>Cheswick shoves his hand higher and glares around. Scanlon shakes his head and then raises his</p>
      <p>hand, keeping his elbow on the arm of the chair. And nobody else. McMurphy can’t say a word.</p>
      <p>“If that’s settled, then,” the nurse says, “perhaps we should get on with the meeting.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah,” he says, slides down in his chair till the brim of his cap nearly touches his chest. “Yeah,</p>
      <p>perhaps we should get on with the sonofabitchin’ meeting at that.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah,” Cheswick says, giving all the guys a hard look and sitting down, “yeah, get on with the</p>
      <p>godblessed meeting.” He nods stiffly, then settles his chin down on his chest, scowling. He’s pleased</p>
      <p>to  be  sitting  next  to  McMurphy,  feeling  brave  like  this.  It’s  the  first  time  Cheswick  ever  had</p>
      <p>somebody along with him on his lost causes.</p>
      <p>[106] After the meeting McMurphy won’t say a word to any of them, he’s so mad and disgusted.</p>
      <p>It’s Billy Bibbit who goes up to him.</p>
      <p>“Some of us have b-been here for fi-fi-five years, Randle,” Billy says. He’s got a magazine rolled</p>
      <p>up and is twisting at it  with his hands; you can see the cigarette burns on the backs of his hands.</p>
      <p>“And some of us will b-be here maybe th-that muh-muh-much longer, long after you’re g-g-gone,</p>
      <p>long after this Wo-world Series is over. And ... don’t you see …” He throws down the magazine and</p>
      <p>walks away. “Oh, what’s the use of it anyway.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy stares after him, that puzzled frown knotting his bleached eyebrows together again.</p>
      <p>He argues for the rest of the day with some of the other guys about why they didn’t vote, but</p>
      <p>they don’t want to talk about it, so he seems to give up, doesn’t say anything about it again till the</p>
      <p>day before the Series starts. “Here it is Thursday,” he says, sadly shaking his head.</p>
      <p>He’s sitting on one of the tables in the tub room with his feet on a chair, trying to spin his cap</p>
      <p>around one finger. Other Acutes mope around the room and try not to pay any attention to him.</p>
      <p>Nobody’ll play poker or blackjack with him for money any more—after the patients wouldn’t vote</p>
      <p>he  got  mad  and  skinned  them  so  bad  at  cards  that  they’re  all  so  in  debt  they’re  scared to  go  any</p>
      <p>deeper—and they can’t play for cigarettes because the nurse has started making the men keep their</p>
      <p>cartons on the desk in the Nurses’ Station, where she doles them out one pack a day, says it’s for</p>
      <p>their health, but everybody knows it’s to keep McMurphy from winning them all at cards. With no</p>
      <p>poker or blackjack, it’s quiet in the tub room, just the sound of the speaker drifting in from the day</p>
      <p>room.  It’s  so  quiet  you  can  hear  that  guy  upstairs  in  Disturbed  climbing  the  wall,  giving  out  an</p>
      <p>occasional signal, loo loo looo, a bored, uninterested sound, like a baby yells to yell itself to sleep.</p>
      <p>“Thursday,” McMurphy says again.</p>
      <p>“Looooo,” yells that guy upstairs.</p>
      <p>“That’s Rawler,” Scanlon says, looking up at the ceiling. He don’t want to pay any attention to</p>
      <p>McMurphy. “Rawler the Squawler. He came through this ward a few years back. Wouldn’t keep still</p>
      <p>to suit Miss Ratched, you remember, Billy? Loo loo loo all the time till I thought I’d go nuts. What</p>
      <p>they should do with that whole bunch of dingbats up there is toss a couple of grenades in the dorm.</p>
      <p>They’re no use to anybody—”</p>
      <p>[107] “And tomorrow is Friday,” McMurphy says. He won’t let Scanlon change the subject.</p>
      <p>“Yeah,” Cheswick says, scowling around the room, “tomorrow is Friday.”</p>
      <p>Harding turns a page of his magazine. “And that will make nearly a week our friend McMurphy</p>
      <p>has been with us without succeeding in throwing over the government, is that what you’re saying,</p>
      <p>Cheswickle?  Lord,  to  think  of  the  chasm  of  apathy  in  which  we  have  fallen—a  shame,  a  pitiful</p>
      <p>shame.”</p>
      <p>“The  hell  with  that,”  McMurphy  says.  “What  Cheswick  means  is  that  the  first  Series  game  is</p>
      <p>gonna  be  played  on  TV  tomorrow,  and  what  are  we  gonna  be  doin’?  Mopping  up  this  damned</p>
      <p>nursery again.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah,” Cheswick says. “Ol’ Mother Ratched’s Therapeutic Nursery.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>69</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>Against the wall of the tub room I get a feeling like a spy; the mop handle in my hands is made of</p>
      <p>metal instead of wood (metal’s a better conductor) and it’s hollow; there’s plenty of room inside it to</p>
      <p>hide a miniature microphone. If the Big Nurse is hearing this, she’ll really get Cheswick. I take a hard</p>
      <p>ball of gum from my pocket and pick some fuzz off it and hold it in my mouth till it softens.</p>
      <p>“Let me see again,” McMurphy says. “How many of you birds will vote with me if I bring up that</p>
      <p>time switch again?”</p>
      <p>About half the Acutes nod yes, a lot more than would really vote. He puts his hat back on his</p>
      <p>head and leans his chin in his hands.</p>
      <p>“I tell ya, I can’t figure it out. Harding, what’s wrong with you, for crying out loud? You afraid if</p>
      <p>you raise your hand that old buzzard’ll cut it off.”</p>
      <p>Harding lifts one thin eyebrow. “Perhaps I am; perhaps I am afraid she’ll cut it off if I raise it.”</p>
      <p>“What about you, Billy? Is that what you’re scared of?” “No. I don’t think she’d d-d-do anything,</p>
      <p>but”—he shrugs and sighs and climbs up on the big panel that controls the nozzles on the shower,</p>
      <p>perches up there like a monkey”—but I just don’t think a vote wu-wu-would do any good. Not in</p>
      <p>the l-long run. It’s just no use, M-Mack.”</p>
      <p>“Do any good? Hooee! It’d do you birds some good just to get the exercise lifting that arm.”</p>
      <p>“It’s still a risk, my friend. She always has the capacity to make things worse for us. A baseball</p>
      <p>game isn’t worth the risk,” Harding says.</p>
      <p>“Who the hell says so? Jesus, I haven’t missed a World Series in years. Even when I was in the</p>
      <p>cooler one September they [108] let us bring in a  TV and watch the Series, they’d of had a riot on</p>
      <p>their hands if they hadn’t. I just may have to kick  that damned door down and walk to some bar</p>
      <p>downtown to see the game, just me and my buddy Cheswick.”</p>
      <p>“Now there’s a suggestion with a lot of merit,” Harding says, tossing down his magazine. “Why</p>
      <p>not  bring  that  up  for  vote  in  group  meeting  tomorrow?  ‘Miss  Ratched,  I’d  like  to  move  that  the</p>
      <p>ward be transported en masse to the Idle Hour for beer and television.’ ”</p>
      <p>“I’d second the motion,” Cheswick says. “Damn right.”</p>
      <p>“The hell with that in mass business,” McMurphy says. “I’m tired of looking at you bunch of old</p>
      <p>ladies; when me and Cheswick bust outta here I think by God I’m gonna nail the door shut behind</p>
      <p>me. You guys better stay behind; your mamma probably wouldn’t let you cross the street.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah? Is that it?” Fredrickson has come up behind McMurphy. “You’re just going to raise one</p>
      <p>of those big he-man boots of yours and kick down the door? A real tough guy.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy don’t hardly look at Fredrickson; he’s learned that Fredrickson might act hard-boiled</p>
      <p>now and then, but it’s an act that folds under the slightest scare.</p>
      <p>“What about it, he-man,” Fredrickson keeps on, “are you going to kick down that door and show</p>
      <p>us how tough you are?”</p>
      <p>“No, Fred, I guess not I wouldn’t want to scuff up my boot”</p>
      <p>“Yeah? Okay, you been talking so big, just how would you go about busting out of here?”</p>
      <p>McMurphy takes a  look around him. “Well, I guess I could  knock the mesh outa one of these</p>
      <p>windows with a chair when and if I took a notion. ...”</p>
      <p>“Yeah? You could, could you? Knock it right out? Okay, let’s see you try. Come on, he-man, I’ll</p>
      <p>bet you ten dollars you can’t do it.”</p>
      <p>“Don’t  bother  trying,  Mack,”  Cheswick  says.  “Fredrickson  knows  you’ll  just  break  a  chair  and</p>
      <p>end up on Disturbed. The first day we arrived over here we were given a demonstration about these</p>
      <p>screens. They’re specially made. A technician picked up a chair just like that one you’ve got your feet</p>
      <p>on  and  beat  the  screen  till  the  chair  was  no  more  than  kindling  wood.  Didn’t  hardly  dent  the</p>
      <p>screen.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>70</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Okay then,” McMurphy says, taking a look around him. I can see he’s getting more interested. I</p>
      <p>hope  the  Big  Nurse  isn’t  hearing  this;  he’ll  be  up  on  Disturbed  in  an  hour.  “We  need  something</p>
      <p>heavier. How about a table?”</p>
      <p>“Same as the chair. Same wood, same weight.”</p>
      <p>“All right, by God, let’s just figure out what I’d have to toss [109] through that screen to bust out.</p>
      <p>And  if  you  birds  don’t  think  I’d  do  it  if  I  ever  got  the  urge,  then  you  got  another  think  coming.</p>
      <p>Okay—something  bigger’n  a  table or  a  chair  …  Well,  if  it  was  night  I  might  throw  that  fat  coon</p>
      <p>through it; he’s heavy enough.”</p>
      <p>“Much too soft,” Harding says. “He’d hit the screen and it would dice him like an eggplant.”</p>
      <p>“How about one of the beds?”</p>
      <p>“A bed is too big even if you could lift it. It wouldn’t go through the window.”</p>
      <p>“I could lift it all right. Well, hell, right over there you are: that thing Billy’s sittin’ on. That big</p>
      <p>control panel with all the handles and cranks. That’s hard enough, ain’t it? And it damn well should</p>
      <p>be heavy enough.”</p>
      <p>“Sure,” Fredrickson says. “That’s the same as you kicking your foot through the steel door at the</p>
      <p>front.”</p>
      <p>“What would be wrong with using the panel? It don’t look nailed down.”</p>
      <p>“No,  it’s  not  bolted—there’s  probably  nothing  holding  it  but  a  few  wires—but  look  at  it,  for</p>
      <p>Christsakes.”</p>
      <p>Everybody  looks.  The  panel  is  steel  and  cement,  half  the  size  of  one  of  the  tables,  probably</p>
      <p>weighs four hundred pounds.</p>
      <p>“Okay, I’m looking at it. It don’t look any bigger than hay bales I’ve bucked up onto truck beds.”</p>
      <p>“I’m afraid, my friend, that this contrivance will weigh a bit more than your bales of hay.”</p>
      <p>“About a quarter-ton more, I’d bet,” Fredrickson says.</p>
      <p>“He’s right, Mack,” Cheswick says. “It’d be awful heavy.”</p>
      <p>“Hell, are you birds telling me I can’t lift that dinky little gizmo?”</p>
      <p>“My friend, I don’t recall anything about psychopaths being able to move mountains in addition</p>
      <p>to their other noteworthy assets.”</p>
      <p>“Okay, you say I can’t lift it. Well by God ...”</p>
      <p>McMurphy hops off the table and goes to peeling off his green jacket; the tattoos sticking half</p>
      <p>out of his T-shirt jump around the muscles on his arms.</p>
      <p>“Then who’s willing to lay five bucks? Nobody’s gonna convince me I can’t do something till I</p>
      <p>try it. Five bucks ...”</p>
      <p>“McMurphy, this is as foolhardy as your bet about the nurse.”</p>
      <p>“Who’s got five bucks they want to lose? You hit or you sit. ...”</p>
      <p>The guys all go to signing liens at once; he’s beat them so many times at poker and blackjack they</p>
      <p>can’t wait to get back [110] at him, and this is a certain sure thing. I don’t know what he’s driving at;</p>
      <p>broad and big as he is, it’d take three of him to move that panel, and he knows it. He can just look at</p>
      <p>it and see he probably couldn’t even tip it, let alone lift it. It’d take a giant to lift it off the ground.</p>
      <p>But when the Acutes all get their IOUs signed, he steps up to the panel and lifts Billy Bibbit down</p>
      <p>off it and spits in his big callused palms and slaps them together, rolls his shoulders.</p>
      <p>“Okay, stand outa the way. Sometimes when I go to exertin’ myself I use up all the air nearby and</p>
      <p>grown men faint from suffocation. Stand back. There’s liable to be crackin’ cement and flying steel.</p>
      <p>Get the women and kids someplace safe. Stand back. ...”</p>
      <p>“By golly, he might do it,” Cheswick mutters.</p>
      <p>“Sure, maybe he’ll talk it off the floor,” Fredrickson says.</p>
      <p>“More likely he’ll acquire a beautiful hernia,” Harding says. “Come now, McMurphy, quit acting</p>
      <p>like a fool; there’s no man can lift that thing.”</p>

      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Stand back, sissies, you’re using my oxygen.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy  shifts  his  feet  a  few  times  to  get  a  good  stance,  and  wipes  his  hands  on  his  thighs</p>
      <p>again,  then  leans  down  and  gets  hold  of  the  levers  on  each  side  of  the  panel.  When  he  goes  to</p>
      <p>straining, the guys go to hooting and kidding him. He turns loose and straightens up and shifts his</p>
      <p>feet around again.</p>
      <p>“Giving up?” Fredrickson grins.</p>
      <p>“Just limbering up. Here goes the real effort”—and grabs those levers again.</p>
      <p>And  suddenly  nobody’s  hooting  at him  any more. His  arms  commence  to  swell,  and  the  veins</p>
      <p>squeeze up to the surface. He clinches his eyes, and his lips draw away from his teeth. His head leans</p>
      <p>back, and tendons stand out like coiled ropes running from his heaving neck down both arms to his</p>
      <p>hands.  His  whole  body  shakes  with  the  strain  as  he  tries  to  lift  something  he  knows  he  can’t  lift,</p>
      <p>something everybody knows he can’t lift.</p>
      <p>But, for just a second, when we hear the cement grind at our feet, we think, by golly, he might do</p>
      <p>it.</p>
      <p>Then his breath explodes out of him, and he falls back limp against the wall. There’s blood on</p>
      <p>the levers where he tore his hands. He pants for a minute against the wall with his eyes shut. There’s</p>
      <p>no sound but his scraping breath; nobody’s saying a thing.</p>
      <p>He opens his eyes and looks around at us. One by one he looks at the guys—even at me—then</p>
      <p>he fishes in his pockets for all the IOUs he won the last few days at poker. He bends over [111] the</p>
      <p>table and tries to sort them, but his hands are froze into red claws, and he can’t work the fingers.</p>
      <p>Finally  he  throws  the  whole  bundle  on  the  floor—probably  forty  or  fifty  dollars’  worth  from</p>
      <p>each  man—and  turns  to  walk  out  of  the  tub  room.  He  stops  at  the  door  and  looks  back  at</p>
      <p>everybody standing around.</p>
      <p>“But I tried, though,” he says. “Goddammit, I sure as hell did that much, now, didn’t I?”</p>
      <p>And walks out and leaves those stained pieces of paper on the floor for whoever wants to sort</p>
      <p>through them.</p>

      <p>A visiting doctor covered with gray cobwebs on his yellow skull is addressing the resident boys in</p>
      <p>the staff room.</p>
      <p>I come sweeping past him. “Oh, and what’s this here.” He gives me a look like I’m some kind of</p>
      <p>bug. One of the residents points at his ears, signal that I’m deaf, and the visiting doctor goes on.</p>
      <p>I push my broom up face to face with a big picture Public Relation brought in one time when it</p>
      <p>was fogged so thick I didn’t see him. The picture is a guy fly-fishing somewhere in the mountains,</p>
      <p>looks  like  the  Ochocos  near  Paineville—snow  on  the  peaks  showing  over  the  pines,  long  white</p>
      <p>aspen trunks lining the stream, sheep sorrel growing in sour green patches. The guy is flicking his fly</p>
      <p>in a pool behind a rock. It’s no place for a fly, it’s a place for a single egg on a number-six hook—</p>
      <p>he’d do better to drift the fly over those riffles downstream.</p>
      <p>There’s a path running down through the aspen, and I push my broom down the path a ways and</p>
      <p>sit  down  on  a  rock  and  look  back  out  through  the  frame  at  that  visiting  doctor  talking  with  the</p>
      <p>residents. I can see him stabbing some point in the palm of his hand with his finger, but I can’t hear</p>
      <p>what he says because of the crash of the cold, frothy stream coming down out of the rocks. I can</p>
      <p>smell the snow in the wind where it blows down off the peaks. I can see mole burrows humping</p>
      <p>along under the grass and buffalo weed. It’s a real nice place to stretch your legs and take it easy.</p>
      <p>You forget—if you don’t sit down and make the effort to think back—forget how it was at the</p>
      <p>old hospital. They didn’t have nice places like this  on the walls for you to climb into. They didn’t</p>
      <p>have  TV  or  swimming  pools  or  chicken  twice  a  month.  They  didn’t  have  nothing  but  walls  and</p>
      <p>chairs, confinement jackets it took you hours of hard work to get out of. They’ve learned a lot since</p>
      <p>then. “Come a long way,” says fat-faced Public Relation. They’ve made life look very pleasant with</p>
      <p>paint and decorations and chrome bathroom fixtures. “A man that would want to run away from a</p>
      <p>place as nice as this,” says fat-faced Public Relation, “why, there’d be something wrong with him.”</p>
      <p>[113]  Out  in  the  staff  room  the  visiting  authority  is  hugging  his  elbows  and  shivering  like  he’s</p>
      <p>cold while he answers questions the resident boys ask him. He’s thin and meatless, and his clothes</p>
      <p>flap around his bones. He stands there, hugging his elbows and shivering. Maybe he feels the cold</p>
      <p>snow wind off the peaks too.</p>

      <p>It’s getting hard to locate my bed at night, have to crawl around on my hands and knees feeling</p>
      <p>underneath the springs till I find my gobs of gum stuck there: Nobody complains about all the fog. I</p>
      <p>know why, now: as bad as it is, you can slip back in it and feel safe. That’s what McMurphy can’t</p>
      <p>understand, us wanting to be safe. He keeps trying to drag us out of the fog, out in the open where</p>
      <p>we’d be easy to get at.</p>

      <p>There’s a shipment of frozen parts come Tin downstairs—hearts and kidneys and brains and the</p>
      <p>like.  I  can  hear  them  rumble  into  cold  storage  down  the  coal  chute.  A  guy  sitting  in  the  room</p>
      <p>someplace I can’t see is talking about a guy up on Disturbed killing himself. Old Rawler. Cut both</p>
      <p>nuts off and bled to death, sitting right on the can in the latrine, half a dozen people in there with</p>
      <p>him didn’t know it till he fell off to the floor, dead.</p>
      <p>What makes people so impatient is what I can’t figure; all the guy had to do was wait.</p>

      <p>75</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>15</p>
      <p>I  know  how  they  work  it,  the  fog  machine.  We  had  a  whole  platoon  used  to  operate  fog</p>
      <p>machines around airfields overseas. Whenever intelligence figured there might be a bombing attack,</p>
      <p>or if the generals had something secret they wanted to pull-out of sight, hid so good that even the</p>
      <p>spies on the base couldn’t see what went on—they fogged the field.</p>
      <p>It’s a simple rig: you got an ordinary compressor sucks water out of one tank and a special oil out</p>
      <p>of another tank, and compresses them together, and from the black stem at the end of the machine</p>
      <p>blooms a white cloud of fog that can cover a whole airfield in ninety seconds. The first thing I saw</p>
      <p>when  I  landed  in  Europe  was  the  fog  those  machines  make.  There  were  some  interceptors  close</p>
      <p>after our transport, and soon as it hit ground the fog crew started up the machines. We could look</p>
      <p>out the transport’s round, scratched windows and watch the jeeps draw the machines up close to the</p>
      <p>plane and watch the fog boil out till it rolled across the field and stuck against the windows like wet</p>
      <p>cotton.</p>
      <p>You found your way off the plane by following a little referees’ horn the lieutenant kept blowing,</p>
      <p>sounded like  a goose honking. Soon as you were out of the hatch you couldn’t see no more than</p>
      <p>maybe three feet in any direction. You felt like you were out on that airfield all by yourself. You were</p>
      <p>safe from the enemy, but you were awfully alone. Sounds died and dissolved after a few yards, and</p>
      <p>you couldn’t hear any of the rest of your crew, nothing but that little horn squeaking and honking</p>
      <p>out of a soft furry whiteness so thick that your body just faded into white below the belt; other than</p>
      <p>that brown shirt and brass buckle, you couldn’t see nothing but white, like from the waist down you</p>
      <p>were being dissolved by the fog too.</p>
      <p>And then some guy wandering as lost as you would all of a sudden be right before your eyes, his</p>
      <p>face bigger and clearer than you ever saw a man’s face before in your life. Your eyes were working</p>
      <p>so hard to see in that fog that when something did come in sight every detail was ten times as clear</p>
      <p>as usual, so clear both of you had to look away. When a man showed [117] up you didn’t want to</p>
      <p>look at his face and he didn’t want to look at yours, because it’s painful to see somebody so clear</p>
      <p>that it’s like looking inside him, but then neither did you want to look away and lose him completely.</p>
      <p>You had a choice: you could either strain and look at things that appeared in front of you in the fog,</p>
      <p>painful as it might be, or you could relax and lose yourself.</p>
      <p>When they first used that fog machine on the ward, one they bought from Army Surplus and hid</p>
      <p>in the vents in the new place before we moved in, I kept looking at anything that appeared out of</p>
      <p>the fog as long and hard as I could, to keep track of it, just like I used to do when they fogged the</p>
      <p>airfields in Europe. Nobody’d be blowing a horn to show the way, there was no rope to hold to, so</p>
      <p>fixing my eyes on something was the only way I kept from getting lost. Sometimes I got lost in it</p>
      <p>anyway, got in too deep, trying to hide, and every time I did, it seemed like I always turned up at that</p>
      <p>same  place,  at  that  same metal  door  with  the  row of  rivets  like  eyes  and  no  number,  just  like  the</p>
      <p>room behind that door drew me to it, no matter how hard I tried to stay away, just like the current</p>
      <p>generated by the fiends in that room was conducted in a beam along the fog and pulled me back</p>
      <p>along it like a robot. I’d wander for days in the fog, scared I’d never see another thing, then there’d</p>
      <p>be that door, opening to show me the mattress padding on the other side to stop out the sounds, the</p>
      <p>men standing in a line like zombies among shiny copper wires and tubes pulsing light, and the bright</p>
      <p>scrape  of  arcing  electricity.  I’d  take  my  place  in  the  line  and  wait  my  turn  at  the  table.  The  table</p>
      <p>shaped like à cross, with shadows of a thousand murdered men printed on it, silhouette wrists and</p>
      <p>ankles running under leather straps sweated green with use, a silhouette neck and head running up to</p>
      <p>a silver band goes across the forehead. And a technician at the controls beside the table looking up</p>
      <p>from  his  dials  and  down  the  line  and  pointing  at  me  with  a  rubber  glove.  “Wait,  I  know  that  big</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>76</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>bastard there—better rabbit-punch him or call for some more help or something. He’s an awful case</p>
      <p>for thrashing around.”</p>
      <p>So I used to try not to get in too deep, for fear I’d get lost and turn up at the Shock Shop door. I</p>
      <p>looked hard at anything that came into sight and hung on like a man in a blizzard hangs on a fence</p>
      <p>rail. But they kept making the fog thicker and thicker, and it seemed to me that, no matter how hard</p>
      <p>I tried, two or three times a month I found myself with that door opening in front of me to the acid</p>
      <p>smell of sparks and [118] ozone. In spite of all I could do, it was getting tough to keep from getting</p>
      <p>lost.</p>
      <p>Then  I  discovered  something:  I  don’t  have  to  end  up  at  that  door  if  I  stay  still  when  the  fog</p>
      <p>comes over me and just keep quiet. The trouble was I’d been finding that door my own self because</p>
      <p>I  got  scared  of  being  lost  so  long  and  went  to  hollering  so  they  could  track  me.  In  a  way,  I  was</p>
      <p>hollering for them to track me; I had figured that anything was better’n being lost for good, even the</p>
      <p>Shock Shop. Now, I don’t know. Being lost isn’t so bad.</p>
      <p>All this morning I been waiting for them to fog us in again. The last few days they been doing it</p>
      <p>more and more. It’s my idea they’re doing it on account of McMurphy. They haven’t got him fixed</p>
      <p>with controls yet, and they’re trying to catch him off guard. They can see he’s due to be a problem; a</p>
      <p>half a dozen times already he’s roused Cheswick and Harding and some of the others to where it</p>
      <p>looked like they might actually stand up to one of the black boys—but always, just the time it looked</p>
      <p>like the patient might be helped, the fog would start, like it’s starting now.</p>
      <p>I heard the compressor start pumping in the grill  a few minutes back, just as the guys  went to</p>
      <p>moving tables out of the day room for the therapeutic meeting, and already the mist is oozing across</p>
      <p>the floor so thick my pants legs are wet. I’m cleaning the windows in the door of the glass station,</p>
      <p>and I hear the Big Nurse pick up the phone and call the doctor to tell him we’re just about ready for</p>
      <p>the  meeting,  and  tell  him  perhaps  he’d  best  keep  an  hour  free  this  afternoon  for  a  staff  meeting.</p>
      <p>“The  reason  being,”  she  tells  him,  “I  think  it  is  past  time  to  have  a  discussion  of  the  subject  of</p>
      <p>Patient  Randle  McMurphy  and  whether  he  should  be  on  this  ward  or  not.”  She  listens  a  minute,</p>
      <p>then tells him, “I don’t think it’s wise to let him go on upsetting the patients the way he has the last</p>
      <p>few days.”</p>
      <p>That’s why she’s fogging the ward for the meeting. She don’t usually do that. But now she’s going</p>
      <p>to do something with McMurphy today, probably ship him to Disturbed. I put down my window</p>
      <p>rag and go to my chair at the end of the line of Chronics, barely able to see the guys getting into</p>
      <p>their  chairs  and  the  doctor coming  through  the  door  wiping  his  glasses  like  he  thinks  the  blurred</p>
      <p>look comes from his steamed lenses instead of the fog.</p>
      <p>It’s rolling in thicker than I ever seen it before.</p>
      <p>I can hear them out there, trying to go on with the meeting, talking some nonsense about Billy</p>
      <p>Bibbit’s stutter and how it came about. The words come to me like through water, it’s so [119] thick.</p>
      <p>In fact it’s so much like water it floats me right up out of my chair and I don’t know which end is up</p>
      <p>for a while. Floating makes me a little sick to the stomach at first. I can’t see a thing. I never had it</p>
      <p>so thick it floated me like this.</p>
      <p>The words get dim and loud, off and on, as I float around, but as loud as they get, loud enough</p>
      <p>sometimes I know I’m right next to the guy that’s talking, I still can’t see a thing.</p>
      <p>I  recognize  Billy’s  voice,  stuttering  worse  than  ever  because  he’s  nervous.  “…  fuh-fuh-flunked</p>
      <p>out  of  college  be-be-cause  I  quit  ROTC.  I  c-c-couldn’t  take  it.  Wh-wh-wh-whenever  the  officer  in</p>
      <p>charge of class would call roll, call ‘Bibbit,’ I couldn’t answer. You were s-s-supposed to say heh—</p>
      <p>heh—heh ... He’s choking on the word, like it’s a bone in his throat. I hear him swallow and start</p>
      <p>again. “You were supposed to say, ‘Here sir,’ and I never c-c-could get it out.”</p>
      <p>His voice gets dim; then the Big Nurse’s voice comes cutting from the left. “Can you recall, Billy,</p>
      <p>when you first had speech trouble? When did you first stutter, do you remember?”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>77</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>I can’t tell is he laughing or what. “Fir-first stutter? First stutter? The first word I said I st-stut-</p>
      <p>tered: m-m-m-m-mamma.”</p>
      <p>Then  the  talking  fades  out  altogether:  I  never  knew  that  to  happen  before.  Maybe  Billy’s  hid</p>
      <p>himself in the fog too. Maybe all the guys finally and forever crowded back into the fog.</p>
      <p>A chair and me float past each other. It’s the first thing I’ve seen. It comes sifting out of the fog</p>
      <p>off  to  my  right,  and  for  a  few  seconds  it’s  right  beside  my  face,  just  out  of  my  reach.  I  been</p>
      <p>accustomed of late to just let things alone when they appear in the fog, sit still and not try to hang</p>
      <p>on. But this time I’m scared, the way I used to be scared. I try with all I got to pull myself over to</p>
      <p>the chair and get hold of it, but there’s nothing to brace against and all I can do is thrash the air, all I</p>
      <p>can  do  is  watch  the  chair  come clear,  clearer  than  ever  before  to  where  I  can  even  make  out  the</p>
      <p>fingerprint where a worker touched the varnish before it was dry, looming out for a few seconds,</p>
      <p>then fading on off again. I never seen it where things floated around this way. I never seen it this</p>
      <p>thick before, thick to where I can’t get down to the floor and get on my feet if I wanted to and walk</p>
      <p>around. That’s why I’m so scared; I feel I’m going to float off someplace for good this time.</p>
      <p>I  see  a  Chronic  float  into  sight  a  little below  me.  It’s  old  Colonel  Matterson, reading  from  the</p>
      <p>wrinkled scripture of that long yellow hand. I look close at him because I figure it’s the last time I’ll</p>
      <p>ever see him. His face is enormous, almost more than I can bear. Every hair and wrinkle of him is</p>
      <p>big, as though [120] I was looking at him with one of those microscopes. I see him so clear I see his</p>
      <p>whole life. The face is sixty years of southwest Army camps, rutted by iron-rimmed caisson wheels,</p>
      <p>worn to the bone by thousands of feet on two-day marches.</p>
      <p>He holds out that long hand and brings it up in front of his eyes and squints into it, brings up his</p>
      <p>other hand and underlines the words with a finger wooden and varnished the color of a gunstock by</p>
      <p>nicotine. His voice as deep and slow and patient, and I see the words come out dark and heavy over</p>
      <p>his brittle lips when he reads.</p>
      <p>“No  ...  The  flag  is  ...  Ah-mer-ica.  America  is  ...  the  plum.  The  peach.  The  wah-ter-mel-on.</p>
      <p>America is ... the gumdrop. The pump-kin seed. America is ... tell-ah-vision.”</p>
      <p>It’s true. It’s all wrote down on that yellow hand. I can read it along with him myself.</p>
      <p>“Now ... The cross is ... Mex-i-co.” He looks up to see if I’m paying attention, and when he sees I</p>
      <p>am he smiles at me and goes on. “Mexico is ... the wal-nut. The hazelnut. The ay-corn. Mexico is ...</p>
      <p>the rain-bow. The rain-bow is ... wooden. Mexico is ... woo-den.”</p>
      <p>I can see what he’s driving at. He’s been saying this sort of thing for the whole six years he’s been</p>
      <p>here, but I never paid him any mind, figured he was no more than a talking statue, a thing made out</p>
      <p>of bone and arthritis, rambling on and on with these goofy definitions of his that didn’t make a lick</p>
      <p>of sense. Now, at last, I see what he’s saying. I’m trying to hold him for one last look to remember</p>
      <p>him, and that’s what makes me look hard enough to understand. He pauses and peers up at me again</p>
      <p>to make sure I’m getting it, and I want to yell out to him Yes, I see: Mexico is like the walnut; it’s</p>
      <p>brown and hard and you feel it with your eye and it feels like the walnut! You’re making sense, old</p>
      <p>man, a sense of your own. You’re not crazy the way they think. Yes ... I see ...</p>
      <p>But the fog’s clogged my throat to where I can’t make a sound. As he sifts away I see him bend</p>
      <p>back over that hand.</p>
      <p>“Now ... The green sheep is ... Can-a-da. Canada is … the fir tree. The wheat field. The cal-en-dar</p>
      <p>…”</p>
      <p>I  strain  to  see him  drifting  away.  I  strain  so  hard my  eyes  ache  and  I  have  to close  them,  and</p>
      <p>when I open them again the colonel is gone. I’m floating by myself again, more lost than ever.</p>
      <p>This is the time, I tell myself. I’m going for good.</p>
      <p>There’s old Pete, face like a searchlight. He’s fifty yards off to my left, but I can see him plain as</p>
      <p>though there wasn’t any fog at all. Or maybe he’s up right close and real small, I can’t [121] be sure.</p>
      <p>He  tells  me  once  about how  tired  he  is,  and  just  his  saying  it  makes  me  see  his  whole  life  on  the</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>78</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>railroad, see him working to figure out how to read a watch, breaking a sweat while he tries to get</p>
      <p>the right button in the right hole of his railroad overalls, doing his absolute damnedest to keep up</p>
      <p>with a job that comes so easy to the others they can sit back in a chair padded with cardboard and</p>
      <p>read mystery stories and girlie books. Not that he ever really figured to keep up—he knew from the</p>
      <p>start he couldn’t do that—but he had to try to keep up, just to keep them in sight. So for forty years</p>
      <p>he was able to live, if not right in the world of men, at least on the edge of it.</p>
      <p>I can see all that, and be hurt by it, the way I was hurt by seeing things in the Army, in the war.</p>
      <p>The way I was hurt by seeing what happened to Papa and the tribe. I thought I’d got over seeing</p>
      <p>those things and fretting over them. There’s no sense in it. There’s nothing to be done.</p>
      <p>“I’m tired,” is what he says.</p>
      <p>“I know you’re tired, Pete, but I can’t do you no good fretting about it. You know I can’t.”</p>
      <p>Pete floats on the way of the old colonel.</p>
      <p>Here comes Billy Bibbit, the way Pete come by. They’re all filing by for a last look. I know Billy</p>
      <p>can’t be more’n a few feet away, but he’s so tiny he looks like he’s a mile off. His face is out to me</p>
      <p>like the face of a beggar, needing so much more’n anybody can give. His mouth works like a little</p>
      <p>doll’s mouth.</p>
      <p>“And even when I pr-proposed, I flubbed it. I said ‘Huh-honey, will you muh-muh-muh-muh-</p>
      <p>muh …’ till the girl broke out l-laughing.”</p>
      <p>Nurse’s voice, I can’t see where it comes from: “Your mother has spoken to me about this girl,</p>
      <p>Billy. Apparently she was quite a bit beneath you. What would you speculate it was about her that</p>
      <p>frightened you so, Billy?”</p>
      <p>“I was in luh-love with her.”</p>
      <p>I can’t do nothing for you either, Billy. You know that. None of us can. You got to understand</p>
      <p>that as soon as a man goes to help somebody, he leaves himself wide open. He has to be cagey, Billy,</p>
      <p>you should know that as well as anyone. What could I do? I can’t fix your stuttering. I can’t wipe the</p>
      <p>razorblade scars off your wrists or the cigarette burns off the back of your hands. I can’t give you a</p>
      <p>new  mother.  And  as  far  as  the nurse  riding  you  like  this,  rubbing  your  nose  in  your  weakness  till</p>
      <p>what  little  dignity  you  got  left  is  gone  and  you  shrink  up  to  nothing  from  humiliation,  I  can’t  do</p>
      <p>anything about that, either. At Anzio, I saw a buddy of mine tied to a tree fifty yards [122] from me,</p>
      <p>screaming for water, his face blistered in the sun. They wanted me to try to go out and help him.</p>
      <p>They’d of cut me in half from that farmhouse over there.</p>
      <p>Put your face away, Billy.</p>
      <p>They keep filing past.</p>
      <p>It’s like each face was a  sign  like one of those “I’m Blind” signs the dago accordion players in</p>
      <p>Portland hung around their necks, only these signs say “I’m tired” or “I’m scared” or “I’m dying of</p>
      <p>a bum liver” or “I’m all bound up with machinery and people pushing me alla time.” I can read all the</p>
      <p>signs, it don’t make any difference how little the print gets. Some of the faces are looking around at</p>
      <p>one another and could read the other fellow’s if they would, but what’s the sense? The faces blow</p>
      <p>past in the fog like confetti.</p>
      <p>I’m further off than I’ve ever been. This is what it’s like to be dead. I guess this is what it’s like to</p>
      <p>be a Vegetable; you lose yourself in the fog. You don’t move. They feed your body till it finally stops</p>
      <p>eating; then they burn it. It’s not so bad. There’s no pain. I don’t feel much of anything other than a</p>
      <p>touch of chill I figure will pass in time.</p>
      <p>I see my commanding officer pinning notices on the bulletin board, what we’re to wear today. I</p>
      <p>see the US Department of Interior bearing down on our little tribe with a gravel-crushing machine.</p>
      <p>I see Papa come loping out of a draw and slow up to try and take aim  at a big  six-point buck</p>
      <p>springing off through the cedars. Shot after shot puffs out of the barrel, knocking dust all around</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>79</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>the buck. I come out of the draw behind Papa and bring the buck down with my second shot just as</p>
      <p>it starts climbing the rimrock. I grin at Papa.</p>
      <p>I never knew you to miss a shot like that before, Papa. Eye’s gone, boy. Can’t hold a bead. Sights on my gun just</p>
      <p>now was shakin’ like a dog shittin’ peach pits.</p>
      <p>Papa, I’m telling you: that cactus moon of Sid’s is gonna make you old before your time.</p>
      <p>A man drinks that cactus moon of Sid’s boy, he’s already old before his time. Let’s go gut that animal out before</p>
      <p>the flies blow him.</p>
      <p>That’s not even happening now. You see? There’s nothing you can do about a happening out of</p>
      <p>the past like that.</p>
      <p>Look there, my man …</p>
      <p>I hear whispers, black boys.</p>
      <p>Look there, that old fool Broom, slipped off to sleep.</p>
      <p>Tha’s right, Chief Broom, tha’s right. You sleep an’ keep outta trouble. Yasss.</p>
      <p>[123] I’m not cold any more. I think I’ve about made it. I’m off to where the cold can’t reach me.</p>
      <p>I can stay off here for good. I’m not scared any more. They can’t reach me. Just the words reach me,</p>
      <p>and those’re fading.</p>
      <p>Well ... in as much as Billy has decided to walk out on the discussion, does anyone else have a problem to bring</p>
      <p>before the group?</p>
      <p>As a matter of fact, ma’am, there does happen to be something …</p>
      <p>That’s that McMurphy. He’s far away. He’s still trying to pull people out of the fog. Why don’t he</p>
      <p>leave me be?</p>
      <p>“... remember that vote we had a day or so back-about the TV time? Well, today’s Friday and I</p>
      <p>thought I might just bring it up again, just to see if anybody else has picked up a little guts.”</p>
      <p>“Mr. McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy, group therapy, and I’m not certain these</p>
      <p>petty grievances—”</p>
      <p>“Yeah,  yeah,  the  hell  with  that,  we’ve  heard  it  before.  Me  and  some  of  the  rest  of  the  guys</p>
      <p>decided—”</p>
      <p>“One moment, Mr. McMurphy, let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mr.</p>
      <p>McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on some of you too much? I’ve been thinking</p>
      <p>you might be happier if he were moved to a different ward.”</p>
      <p>Nobody says anything for a minute. Then someone says, “Let him vote, why dontcha? Why ya</p>
      <p>want to ship him to Disturbed just for bringing up a vote? What’s so wrong with changing time?”</p>
      <p>“Why, Mr. Scanlon, as I recall, you refused to eat for three days until we allowed you to turn the</p>
      <p>set on at six instead of six-thirty.”</p>
      <p>“A man needs to see the world news, don’t he? God, they coulda bombed Washington and it’d</p>
      <p>been a week before we’d of heard.”</p>
      <p>“Yes? And how do you feel about relinquishing your world news to watch a bunch of men play</p>
      <p>baseball?”</p>
      <p>“We  can’t  have  both,  huh?  No,  I  suppose  not.  Well,  what  the  dickens—I  don’t  guess  they’ll</p>
      <p>bomb us this week.” “Let’s let him have the vote, Miss Ratched.”</p>
      <p>“Very well. But I think this is ample evidence of how much he is upsetting some of you patients.</p>
      <p>What is it you are proposing, Mr. McMurphy?”</p>
      <p>“I’m proposing a revote on watching the TV in the afternoon.”</p>
      <p>[124] “You’re certain one more vote will satisfy you? We have more important things—”</p>
      <p>“It’ll satisfy me. I just’d kind of like to see which of these birds has any guts and which doesn’t.”</p>
      <p>“It’s  that  kind  of talk,  Doctor  Spivey,  that  makes me  wonder  if  the patients  wouldn’t be  more</p>
      <p>content if Mr. McMurphy were moved.”</p>
      <p>“Let him call the vote, why dontcha?”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>80</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Certainly, Mr. Cheswick. A vote is now before the group. Will a show of hands be adequate, Mr.</p>
      <p>McMurphy, or are you going to insist on a secret ballot?”</p>
      <p>“I want to see the hands. I want to see the hands that don’t go up, too.”</p>
      <p>“Everyone in favor of changing the television time to the afternoon, raise his hand.”</p>
      <p>The  first  hand  that  comes  up,  I  can  tell,  is  McMurphy’s,  because  of  the  bandage  where  that</p>
      <p>control panel cut into him when he tried to lift it. And then off down the slope I see them, other</p>
      <p>hands coming up out of the fog. It’s like ... that big red hand of McMurphy’s is reaching into the fog</p>
      <p>and dropping down and dragging the men up by their hands, dragging them blinking into the open.</p>
      <p>First one, then another, then the next. Right on down the line of Acutes, dragging them out of the</p>
      <p>fog  till  there  they  stand,  all  twenty  of  them,  raising  not  just  for  watching  TV,  but  against  the  Big</p>
      <p>Nurse,  against  her  trying  to  send  McMurphy to Disturbed,  against  the  way  she’s  talked  and  acted</p>
      <p>and beat them down for years.</p>
      <p>Nobody says anything. I can feel how stunned everybody is, the patients as well as the staff. The</p>
      <p>nurse can’t figure what happened; yesterday, before he tried lifting that panel, there wasn’t but four</p>
      <p>or five men might of voted. But when she talks she don’t let it show in her voice how surprised she</p>
      <p>is.</p>
      <p>“I count only twenty, Mr. McMurphy.”</p>
      <p>“Twenty?  Well,  why  not? Twenty  is  all  of  us  there—”  His  voice  hangs  as  he  realizes  what  she</p>
      <p>means. “Now hold on just a goddamned minute, lady—”</p>
      <p>“I’m afraid the vote is defeated.”</p>
      <p>“Hold on just one goddamned minute!”</p>
      <p>“There  are  forty  patients  on  the  ward,  Mr.  McMurphy.  Forty  patients,  and  only  twenty  voted.</p>
      <p>You must have a majority to change the ward policy. I’m afraid the vote is closed.”</p>
      <p>The hands are coming down across the room. The guys know they’re whipped, are trying to slip</p>
      <p>back into the safety of the fog. McMurphy is on his feet.</p>
      <p>“Well, I’ll be a sonofabitch. You mean to tell me that’s how [125] you’re gonna pull it? Count the</p>
      <p>votes of those old birds over there too?”</p>
      <p>“Didn’t you explain the voting procedure to him, Doctor?”</p>
      <p>“I’m afraid—a majority is called for, McMurphy. She’s right, she’s right.”</p>
      <p>“A majority, Mr. McMurphy; it’s in the ward constitution.” “And I suppose the way to change</p>
      <p>the damned constitution is with a majority vote. Sure. Of all the chicken-shit things I’ve ever seen,</p>
      <p>this by God takes the cake!”</p>
      <p>“I’m sorry, Mr. McMurphy, but you’ll find it written in the policy if you’d care for me to—”</p>
      <p>“So this’s how you work this democratic bullshit—hell’s bells!”</p>
      <p>“You seem upset, Mr. McMurphy. Doesn’t he seem upset, Doctor? I want you to note this.”</p>
      <p>“Don’t  give  me  that  noise,  lady.  When  a  guy’s  getting  screwed  he’s  got  a  right  to  holler.  And</p>
      <p>we’ve been damn well screwed.”</p>
      <p>“Perhaps, Doctor, in view of the patient’s condition, we should bring this meeting to a close early</p>
      <p>today—”</p>
      <p>“Wait! Wait a minute, let me talk to some of those old guys.”</p>
      <p>“The vote is closed, Mr. McMurphy.”</p>
      <p>“Let me talk to ‘em.”</p>
      <p>He’s coming across the day room at us. He gets bigger and bigger, and he’s burning red in the</p>
      <p>face. He reaches into the fog and tries to drag Ruckly to the surface because Ruckly’s the youngest.</p>
      <p>“What about you, buddy? You want to watch the World Series? Baseball? Baseball games? Just</p>
      <p>raise that hand up there—”</p>
      <p>“Fffffffuck da wife.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>81</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“All right, forget it. You, partner, how about you? What was your name—Ellis? What do you say,</p>
      <p>Ellis, to watching a ball game on TV? Just raise your hand. ...”</p>
      <p>Ellis’s hands are nailed to the wall, can’t be counted as a vote.</p>
      <p>“I said the voting is closed, Mr. McMurphy. You’re just making a spectacle of yourself.”</p>
      <p>He don’t pay any attention to her. He comes on down the line of Chronics. “C’mon, c’mon, just</p>
      <p>one vote from you birds, just raise a hand. Show her you can still do it.”</p>
      <p>“I’m tired,” says Pete and wags his head.</p>
      <p>“The night is ... the Pacific Ocean.” The Colonel is reading off his hand, can’t be bothered with</p>
      <p>voting.</p>
      <p>“One of you guys, for cryin’ out loud! This is where you get [126] the edge, don’t you see that? We</p>
      <p>have to do this—or we’re whipped! Don’t a one of you clucks know what I’m talking about enough to</p>
      <p>give us a hand? You, Gabriel? George? No? You, Chief, what about you?</p>
      <p>He’s standing over me in the mist. Why won’t he leave me be?</p>
      <p>“Chief, you’re our last bet.”</p>
      <p>The Big Nurse is folding her papers; the other nurses are standing up around her. She finally gets</p>
      <p>to her feet.</p>
      <p>“The meeting is adjourned, then, I hear her say. “And I’d like to see the staff down in the staff</p>
      <p>room in about an hour. So, if there is nothing el—”</p>
      <p>It’s too late to stop it now. McMurphy did something to it that first day, put some kind of hex on</p>
      <p>it with his hand so it won’t act like I order it. There’s no sense in it, any fool can see; I wouldn’t do it</p>
      <p>on my own. Just by the way the nurse is staring at me with her mouth empty of words I can see I’m</p>
      <p>in for trouble, but I can’t stop it. McMurphy’s got hidden wires hooked to it, lifting it slow just to</p>
      <p>get me out of the fog and into the open where I’m fair game. He’s doing it, wires ...</p>
      <p>No. That’s not the truth. I lifted it myself.</p>
      <p>McMurphy whoops and drags me standing, pounding my back.</p>
      <p>“Twenty-one! The Chief’s vote makes it twenty-one! And by God if that ain’t a majority I’ll eat</p>
      <p>my hat!”</p>
      <p>“Yippee,” Cheswick yells. The other Acutes are coming across toward me.</p>
      <p>“The meeting was closed,” she says. Her smile is still there, but the back of her neck as she walks</p>
      <p>out  of  the  day  room  and  into  the  Nurses’  Station,  is  red  and  swelling  like  she’ll  blow  apart  any</p>
      <p>second.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>But she don’t blow up, not right off, not until about an hour later. Behind the glass her smile is</p>
      <p>twisted and queer, like we’ve never seen before. She just sits. I can see her shoulders rise and fall as</p>
      <p>she breathes.</p>
      <p>McMurphy looks up at the clock and he says it’s time for the game. He’s over by the drinking</p>
      <p>fountain  with  some  of  the  other  Acutes,  down  on  his  knees  scouring  off  the  baseboard.  I’m</p>
      <p>sweeping out the broom closet for the tenth time that day. Scanlon and Harding, they got the buffer</p>
      <p>going up and down the hall, polishing the new wax into shining figure eights. McMurphy says again</p>
      <p>that he guesses it must be game time and he stands up, leaves the scouring rag where it lies. Nobody</p>
      <p>else stops work. McMurphy walks past the window where she’s [127] glaring out at him and grins at</p>
      <p>her like he knows he’s got her whipped now. When he tips his head back and winks at her she gives</p>
      <p>that little sideways jerk of her head.</p>
      <p>Everybody keeps on at what he’s doing, but they all watch out of the corners of their eyes while</p>
      <p>he drags his armchair out to in front of the TV set, then switches on the set and sits down. A picture</p>
      <p>swirls  onto  the  screen  of  a  parrot out  on  the  baseball  field  singing  razor-blade  songs.  McMurphy</p>
      <p>gets  up  and  turns  up  the  sound  to  drown  out  the  music  coming  down  from  the  speaker  in  the</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>82</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>ceiling, and he drags another chair in front of him and sits down and crosses his feet on the chair</p>
      <p>and leans back and lights a cigarette. He scratches his belly and yawns.</p>
      <p>“Hoo-weee! Man, all I need me now is a can of beer and a red-hot.”</p>
      <p>We can see the nurse’s face get red and her mouth work as she stares at him. She looks around</p>
      <p>for a second and sees everybody’s watching what she’s going to do—even the black boys and the</p>
      <p>little  nurses  sneaking  looks  at  her,  and  the  residents  beginning  to  drift  in  for  the  staff  meeting,</p>
      <p>they’re watching. Her mouth clamps shut. She looks back at McMurphy and waits till the razor-blade</p>
      <p>song is finished; then she gets up and goes to the steel door where the controls are, and she flips a</p>
      <p>switch and the TV picture swirls back into the gray. Nothing is left on the screen but a little eye of</p>
      <p>light beading right down on McMurphy sitting there.</p>
      <p>That  eye  don’t  faze  him  a  bit.  To  tell  the  truth,  he  don’t  even  let  on  he  knows  the  picture  is</p>
      <p>turned off; he puts his cigarette between his teeth and pushes his cap forward in his red hair till he</p>
      <p>has to lean back to see out from under the brim.</p>
      <p>And  sits  that  way,  with  his  hands  crossed  behind  his  head  and  his  feet  stuck  out  in  a  chair,  a</p>
      <p>smoking cigarette sticking out from under his hatbrim—watching the TV screen.</p>
      <p>The nurse stands this as long as she can; then she comes to the door of the Nurses’ Station and</p>
      <p>calls across to him he’d better help the men with the housework. He ignores her.</p>
      <p>“I said, Mr. McMurphy, that you are supposed to be working during these hours.” Her voice has</p>
      <p>a tight whine like an electric saw ripping through pine. “Mr. McMurphy, I’m warning you!”</p>
      <p>Everybody’s  stopped  what  he  was  doing.  She  looks  around  her,  then  takes  a  step  out  of  the</p>
      <p>Nurses’ Station toward McMurphy.</p>
      <p>“You’re committed, you realize. You are ... under the jurisdiction of me ... the staff.” She’s holding</p>
      <p>up  a  fist,  all  [128]  those  red-orange  fingernails  burning  into  her  palm.  “Under  jurisdiction  and</p>
      <p>control—”</p>
      <p>Harding  shuts  off  the  buffer,  and  leaves  it  in  the hall,  and  goes  pulls  him  a  chair  up  alongside</p>
      <p>McMurphy and sits down and lights him a cigarette too.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Harding! You return to your scheduled duties!”</p>
      <p>I think how her voice sounds like it hit a nail, and this strikes me so funny I almost laugh.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Har-ding!”</p>
      <p>Then Cheswick goes and gets him a chair, and then Billy Bibbit goes, and then Scanlon and then</p>
      <p>Fredrickson and Sefelt, and then we all put down our mops and brooms and scouring rags and we</p>
      <p>all go pull us chairs up.</p>
      <p>“You men—Stop this. Stop!”</p>
      <p>And we’re all sitting there lined up in front of that blanked-out TV set, watching the gray screen</p>
      <p>just like we could see the baseball game clear as day, and she’s ranting and screaming behind us.</p>
      <p>If  somebody’d  of  come  in  and  took  a  look,  men  watching  a  blank  TV,  a  fifty-year-old  woman</p>
      <p>hollering  and  squealing  at  the  back  of  their  heads  about  discipline  and  order  and  recriminations,</p>
      <p>they’d of thought the whole bunch was crazy as loons.</p>

      </p><p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>16</p>
      <p>Just at the edge of my vision I can see that white enamel face in the Nurses’ Station, teetering</p>
      <p>over  the  desk,  see  it  warp  and  flow  as  it  tries  to  pull  back  into  shape.  The  rest  of  the  guys  are</p>
      <p>watching too, though they’re trying to act like they aren’t. They’re trying to act like they still got their</p>
      <p>eyes on nothing but that blank TV in front of us, but anyone can see they’re all sneaking looks at the</p>
      <p>Big Nurse behind her glass there, just the same as I am. For the first time she’s on the other side of</p>
      <p>the glass and getting a taste of how it feels to be watched when you wish more than anything else to</p>
      <p>be able to pull a green shade between your face and all the eyes that you can’t get away from.</p>
      <p>The residents, the black boys, all the little nurses, they’re watching her too, waiting for her to go</p>
      <p>down the  hall  where  it’s  time  for  the meeting  she herself  called,  and  waiting  to  see how  she’ll  act</p>
      <p>now  that  it’s  known  she  can  be  made  to  lose  control.  She  knows  they’re  watching,  but  she  don’t</p>
      <p>move.  Not  even  when  they  start  strolling  down  to  the  staff  room  without  her.  I  notice  all  the</p>
      <p>machinery in the wall is quiet, like it’s still waiting for her to move.</p>
      <p>[130] There’s no more fog any place.</p>
      <p>All of a sudden I remember I’m supposed to clean the staff room. I always go down and clean</p>
      <p>the staff room during these meetings they have, been doing it for years. But now I’m too scared to</p>
      <p>get out of my chair. The staff always let me clean the room because they didn’t think I could hear,</p>
      <p>but now that they saw me lift my hand when McMurphy told me to, won’t they know I can hear?</p>
      <p>Won’t they figure I been hearing all these years, listening to secrets meant only for their ears? What’ll</p>
      <p>they do to me in that staff room if they know that?</p>
      <p>Still, they expect me to be in there. If I’m not, they’ll know for sure that I can hear, be way ahead</p>
      <p>of  me,  thinking,  You  see?  He  isn’t  in here  cleaning,  don’t that prove  it?  It’s  obvious  what’s  to be</p>
      <p>done. …</p>
      <p>I’m just getting the full force of the dangers we let ourselves in for when we let McMurphy lure</p>
      <p>us out of the fog.</p>
      <p>There’s a black boy leaning against the wall near the door, arms crossed, pink tongue tip darting</p>
      <p>back and forth over his lips, watching us sitting in front of the TV set. His eyes dart back and forth</p>
      <p>like his tongue and stop on me, and I see his leather eyelids raise a little. He watches me for a long</p>
      <p>time, and I know he’s wondering about the way I acted in the group meeting. Then he comes off the</p>
      <p>wall with a lurch, breaking contact, and goes to the broom closet and brings back a bucket of soapy</p>
      <p>water and a sponge, drags my arms up and hangs the bucket bale over it, like hanging a kettle on a</p>
      <p>fireplace boom.</p>
      <p>“Le’s go, Chief,” he says. “Le’s get up and get to your duties.”</p>
      <p>I don’t move. The bucket rocks on my arm. I don’t make a sign I heard. He’s trying to trick me.</p>
      <p>He  asks  me  again  to  get  up,  and  when  I  don’t move  he  rolls  his  eyes  up to the  ceiling  and  sighs,</p>
      <p>reaches  down  and  takes  my  collar,  and  tugs  a  little,  and  I  stand  up.  He  stuffs  the  sponge  in  my</p>
      <p>pocket and points up the hall where the staff room is, and I go.</p>
      <p>And while I’m walking up the hall with the bucket, zoom, the Big Nurse comes past me with all</p>
      <p>her old calm speed and power and turns into the door. That makes me wonder.</p>
      <p>Out in the hall all by myself, I notice how clear it is—no fog any place. It’s a little cold where the</p>
      <p>nurse just went past, and the white tubes in the ceiling circulate frozen light like rods of glowing ice,</p>
      <p>like frosted refrigerator coils rigged up to glow white. The rods stretch down to the staff-room door</p>
      <p>where the nurse just turned in at the end of the hall—a heavy steel door like the door of the Shock</p>
      <p>Shop in Building One, except there are numbers printed on this one, and this one has a little glass</p>
      <p>[131] peephole up head-high to let the staff peek out at who’s knocking. As I get closer I see there’s</p>
      <p>light seeping out this peephole, green light, bitter as bile. The staff meeting is about to start in there,</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>85</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>is why there’s this green seepage; it’ll be all over the walls and windows by the time the meeting is</p>
      <p>halfway  through,  for me  to  sponge  off  and  squeeze  in  my  bucket,  use the  water  later  to  clear  the</p>
      <p>drains in the latrine.</p>
      <p>Cleaning  the  staff  room  is  always  bad.  The  things  I’ve  had  to  clean  up  in  these  meetings</p>
      <p>nobody’d believe; horrible things, poisons manufactured right out of skin pores and acids in the air</p>
      <p>strong enough to melt a man. I’ve seen it.</p>
      <p>I been in some meetings where the table legs strained and contorted and the chairs knotted and</p>
      <p>the walls gritted against one another till you could of wrung sweat out the room. 1 been in meetings</p>
      <p>where they kept talking about a patient so long that the patient materialized in the flesh, nude on the</p>
      <p>coffee table in front of them, vulnerable to any fiendish notion they took; they’d have him smeared</p>
      <p>around in an awful mess before they were finished.</p>
      <p>That’s  why  they  have  me  at  the  staff  meetings,  because  they  can  be  such  a  messy  affair  and</p>
      <p>somebody has to clean up, and since the staff room is open only during the meetings it’s got to be</p>
      <p>somebody they think won’t be able to spread the word what’s going on. That’s me. I been at it so</p>
      <p>long, sponging and dusting and mopping this staff room and the old wooden one at the other place,</p>
      <p>that the staff usually don’t even notice me; I move around in my chores, and they see right through</p>
      <p>me like I wasn’t there—the only thing they’d miss if I didn’t show up would be the sponge and the</p>
      <p>water bucket floating around.</p>
      <p>But this time when I tap at the door and the Big Nurse looks through the peephole she looks</p>
      <p>dead at me, and she takes longer than ordinary unlocking that door to let me in. Her face has come</p>
      <p>back into shape, strong as ever, it seems to me. Everybody else goes ahead spooning sugar in their</p>
      <p>coffee and borrowing cigarettes, the way they do before every meeting, but there’s a tenseness in the</p>
      <p>air. I think it’s because of me at first. Then I notice that the Big Nurse hasn’t even sat down, hasn’t</p>
      <p>even bothered to get herself a cup of coffee.</p>
      <p>She lets me slip through the door and stabs me again with both eyes as I go past her, closes that</p>
      <p>door  when  I’m  in  and  locks  it,  and  pivots  around  and  glares  at  me  some  more.  I  know  she’s</p>
      <p>suspicious. I thought she might be too upset by the way McMurphy defied her to pay any attention</p>
      <p>to  me,  but  she  don’t  look  shook  at  all.  She’s  clear-headed  and  wondering  now  just  how  did  Mr.</p>
      <p>Bromden  hear  that  Acute  McMurphy  asking  [132]  him  to  raise  his  hand  on  that  vote?  She’s</p>
      <p>wondering how did he know to lay down his mop and go sit with the Acutes in front of that TV set?</p>
      <p>None of the other Chronics did that. She’s wondering if it isn’t time we did some checking on our</p>
      <p>Mr. Chief Bromden.</p>
      <p>I put my back to her and dig into the corner with my sponge. I lift the sponge up above my head</p>
      <p>so everybody in the room can see how it’s covered with green slime and how hard I’m working; then</p>
      <p>I bend over and rub harder than ever. But hard as I work and hard as I try to act like I’m not aware</p>
      <p>of her back there, I can still feel her standing at the door and drilling into my skull till in a minute</p>
      <p>she’s going to break through, till I’m just about to give up and yell and tell them everything if she</p>
      <p>don’t take those eyes off me.</p>
      <p>Then  she  realizes  that  she’s  being  stared  at  too—by  all  the  rest  of  the  staff.  Just  like  she’s</p>
      <p>wondering  about  me,  they  are  wondering  about  her  and  what  she’s  planning  to  do  about  that</p>
      <p>redhead back down there in the day room. They’re watching to see what she’ll say about him, and</p>
      <p>they  don’t  care  anything  about  some  fool  Indian  on  his  hands  and  knees  in  the  corner.  They’re</p>
      <p>waiting for her so she quits looking at me and goes and draws a cup of coffee and sits down, stirs</p>
      <p>sugar in it so careful the spoon never touches the side of the cup.</p>
      <p>It’s the doctor who starts things off. “Now, people, if we can get things rolling?”</p>
      <p>He smiles around at the residents sipping coffee. He’s trying not to look at the Big Nurse. She’s</p>
      <p>sitting there so silent it makes him nervous and fidgety. He grabs out his glasses and puts them on</p>
      <p>for a look at his watch, goes to winding it while he talks.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>86</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Fifteen after. It’s past time we started. Now. Miss Ratched, as most of you know, called this get-</p>
      <p>together. She phoned me before the Therapeutic Community meeting and said that in her opinion</p>
      <p>McMurphy  was  due  to  constitute  a  disturbance  on  the  ward.  Ever  so  intuitive,  considering  what</p>
      <p>went on a few minutes ago, don’t you think?”</p>
      <p>He stops winding his watch on account of it’s tight enough another twist is going to spray it all</p>
      <p>over the place, and he sits there smiling at it, drumming the back of his hand with pink little fingers,</p>
      <p>waiting. Usually at about this point in the meeting she’ll take over, but she doesn’t say anything.</p>
      <p>“After  today,”  the  doctor  goes  on,  “no  one  can  say  that  this  is  an  ordinary  man  we’re  dealing</p>
      <p>with. No, certainly not. And he is a disturbing factor, that’s obvious. So—ah—as I see it, our course</p>
      <p>in this discussion is to decide what action to take [133] in dealing with him. I believe the nurse called</p>
      <p>this meeting—correct me if I’m off base here, Miss Ratched—to talk the situation out and unify the</p>
      <p>staff’s opinion of what should be done about Mr. McMurphy?”</p>
      <p>He gives her a pleading look, but she still doesn’t say anything. She’s lifted her face toward the</p>
      <p>ceiling, checking for dirt most likely, and doesn’t appear to have heard a thing he’s been saying.</p>
      <p>The doctor turns to the line of residents across the room; all of them got the same leg crossed</p>
      <p>and  coffee  cup  on  the  same  knee.  “You  fellows,”  the  doctor  says,  “I  realize  you  haven’t  had</p>
      <p>adequate time to arrive at a proper diagnosis of the patient, but you have had a chance at observing</p>
      <p>him in action. What do you think?”</p>
      <p>The question pops their heads up. Cleverly, he’s put them on the carpet too. They all look from</p>
      <p>him  to  the  Big  Nurse.  Some  way  she  has  regained  all  her  old  power  in  a  few  short  minutes.  Just</p>
      <p>sitting there, smiling up at the ceiling and not saying anything, she has taken control again and made</p>
      <p>everyone  aware  that  she’s  the  force  in  here  to  be dealt  with.  If  these  boys  don’t play  it  just  right</p>
      <p>they’re liable to finish their training up in Portland at the alky hospital. They begin to fidget around</p>
      <p>like the doctor.</p>
      <p>“He’s quite a disturbing influence, all right.” The first boy plays it safe.</p>
      <p>They all sip their coffee and think about that. Then the next one says, “And he could constitute</p>
      <p>an actual danger.”</p>
      <p>“That’s true, that’s true,” the doctor says.</p>
      <p>The boy thinks he may have found the key and goes on. “Quite a danger, in fact,” he says and</p>
      <p>moves forward in his chair. “Keep in mind that this man performed violent acts for the sole purpose</p>
      <p>of getting away from the work farm and into the comparative luxury of this hospital.”</p>
      <p>“Planned violent acts,” the first boy says.</p>
      <p>And  the  third  boy  mutters,  “Of  course,  the  very  nature  of  this  plan  could  indicate  that  he  is</p>
      <p>simply a shrewd con man, and not mentally ill at all.”</p>
      <p>He glances around to see how this strikes her and sees she still hasn’t moved or given any sign.</p>
      <p>But the rest of the staff sits there glaring at him like he’s said some awful vulgar thing. He sees how</p>
      <p>he’s  stepped  way  out  of  bounds  and  tries  to  bring  it  off  as  a  joke  by  giggling  and  adding,  “You</p>
      <p>know,  like  ‘He  Who  Marches  Out  Of  Step  Hears  Another  Drum’  ”—but  it’s  too  late.  The  first</p>
      <p>resident turns on him after setting down his [134] cup of coffee and reaching in his pocket for a pipe</p>
      <p>big as your fist.</p>
      <p>“Frankly, Alvin,” he says to the third boy, “I’m disappointed in you. Even if one hadn’t read his</p>
      <p>history all one should need to do is pay attention to his behavior on the ward to realize how absurd</p>
      <p>the  suggestion  is.  This  man  is  not  only  very  very  sick,  but  I  believe  he  is  definitely  a  Potential</p>
      <p>Assaultive. I think that is what Miss Ratched was suspecting when she called this meeting. Don’t you</p>
      <p>recognize the arch type of psychopath? I’ve never heard of a clearer case. This man is a Napoleon, a</p>
      <p>Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun.”</p>
      <p>Another  one  joins  in.  He  remembers  the  nurse’s  comments  about  Disturbed.  “Robert’s  right,</p>
      <p>Alvin.  Didn’t  you  see  the  way  the  man  acted  out  there  today?  When  one  of  his  schemes  was</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>87</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>thwarted he was up out of his chair, on the verge of violence. You tell us, Doctor Spivey, what do</p>
      <p>his records say about violence?”</p>
      <p>“There is a marked disregard for discipline and authority,” the doctor says.</p>
      <p>“Right.  His  history  shows,  Alvin,  that  time  and  again  he  has  acted  out  his  hostilities  against</p>
      <p>authority figures—in school, in the service, in jail! And I think that his performance after the voting</p>
      <p>furor today is as conclusive an indication as we can have of what to expect in the future.” He stops</p>
      <p>and frowns into his pipe, puts it back in his mouth, and strikes a match and sucks the flame into the</p>
      <p>bowl  with  a  loud  popping  sound.  When  it’s  lit  he  sneaks  a  look  up  through  the  yellow  cloud  of</p>
      <p>smoke  at  the  Big  Nurse;  he  must  take  her  silence  as  agreement  because  he  goes  on,  more</p>
      <p>enthusiastic and certain than before.</p>
      <p>“Pause for a minute and imagine, Alvin,” he says, his words cottony with smoke, “imagine what</p>
      <p>will happen to one of us when we’re alone in Individual Therapy with Mr. McMurphy. Imagine you</p>
      <p>are approaching a particularly painful breakthrough and he decides he’s just had all he can take of</p>
      <p>your—how  would  he  put  it?—your  ‘damn  fool  collitch-kid  pryin’!’  You  tell  him  he  mustn’t  get</p>
      <p>hostile and he says ‘to hell with that,’ and tell him to calm down, in an authoritarian voice, of course,</p>
      <p>and here he comes, all two hundred and ten red-headed psychopathic Irishman pounds of him, right</p>
      <p>across the interviewing table at you. Are you—are any of us, for that matter—prepared to deal with</p>
      <p>Mr. McMurphy when these moments arise?”</p>
      <p>He puts his size-ten pipe back in the corner of his mouth and spreads his hands on his knees and</p>
      <p>waits. Everybody’s thinking about McMurphy’s thick red arms and scarred hands [135] and how his</p>
      <p>neck comes out of his T-shirt like a rusty wedge. The resident named Alvin has turned pale at the</p>
      <p>thought, like that yellow pipe smoke his buddy was blowing at him had stained his face.</p>
      <p>“So you believe it would be wise,” the doctor asks, “to send him up to Disturbed?”</p>
      <p>“I believe it would be at the very least safe,” the guy with the pipe answers, closing his eyes.</p>
      <p>“I’m afraid I’ll have to withdraw my suggestion and go along with Robert,” Alvin tells them all,</p>
      <p>“if only for my own protection.”</p>
      <p>They  all  laugh.  They’re  all  more  relaxed  now,  certain  they’ve  come  round  to  the  plan  she  was</p>
      <p>wanting. They all have a sip of coffee on it except the guy with the pipe, and he has a big to-do with</p>
      <p>the thing going out all the time, goes through a lot of matches and sucking and puffing and popping</p>
      <p>of his lips. It finally smokes up again to suit him, and he says, a little proudly, “Yes, Disturbed Ward</p>
      <p>for ol’ Red McMurphy, I’m afraid. You know what I think, observing him these few days?”</p>
      <p>“Schizophrenic reaction?” Alvin asks.</p>
      <p>Pipe shakes his head.</p>
      <p>“Latent Homosexual with Reaction Formation?” the third one says.</p>
      <p>Pipe shakes his head again and shuts his eyes. “No,” he says and smiles round the room, “Negative</p>
      <p>Oedipal.”</p>
      <p>They all congratulate him.</p>
      <p>“Yes, I think there is a lot pointing to it,” he says. “But whatever the final diagnosis is, we must</p>
      <p>keep one thing in mind: we’re not dealing with an ordinary man.”</p>
      <p>“You—are very, very wrong, Mr. Gideon.” It’s the Big Nurse.</p>
      <p>Everybody’s head jerks toward her—mine too, but I check myself and pass the motion off like</p>
      <p>I’m trying to scrub a speck I just discovered on the wall above my head. Everybody’s confused all to</p>
      <p>hell  for  sure  now.  They  figured  they  were  proposing  just  what  she’d  want,  just  what  she  was</p>
      <p>planning to propose in the meeting herself. I thought so too. I’ve seen her send men half the size of</p>
      <p>McMurphy  up  to  Disturbed  for  no  more  reason  than  there  was  a  chance  they  might  spit  on</p>
      <p>somebody; now she’s got this bull of a man who’s bucked her and everybody else on the staff, a guy</p>
      <p>she all but said was on his way off the ward earlier this afternoon, and she says no.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>88</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“No. I don’t agree. Not at all.” She smiles around at all of them. “I don’t agree that he should be</p>
      <p>sent  up  to  Disturbed,  which  would  simply  be  an  easy  way  of  passing  our  problem  on  [136]  to</p>
      <p>another ward, and I don’t agree that he is some kind of extraordinary being—some kind of ‘super’</p>
      <p>psychopath.”</p>
      <p>She waits but nobody is about to disagree. For the first time she takes a sip of her coffee; the cup</p>
      <p>comes away from her mouth with that red-orange color on it. I stare at the rim of the cup in spite of</p>
      <p>myself;  she couldn’t  be  wearing  lipstick  that  color.  That  color on  the  rim  of the  cup must  be  from</p>
      <p>heat, touch of her lips set it smoldering.</p>
      <p>“I’ll  admit  that  my  first  thought  when  I  began  to  recognize  Mr.  McMurphy  for  the  disturbing</p>
      <p>force that he is was that he should most definitely be sent up to Disturbed. But now I believe.it is</p>
      <p>too late. Would removing him undo the harm that he has done to our ward? I don’t believe it would,</p>
      <p>not  after  this  afternoon.  I  believe  if  he  were  sent  to  Disturbed  now  it  would  be  exactly  what  the</p>
      <p>patients would expect. He would be a martyr to them. They would never be given the opportunity to</p>
      <p>see that this man is not an—as you put it, Mr. Gideon—‘extraordinary person.’ ”</p>
      <p>She takes another sip and sets the cup on the table; the whack of it sounds like a gavel; all three</p>
      <p>residents sit bold upright.</p>
      <p>“No. He isn’t extraordinary. He is simply a man and no more, and is subject to all the fears and</p>
      <p>all the cowardice and all the timidity that any other man is subject to. Given a few more days, I have</p>
      <p>a very strong feeling that he will prove this, to us as well as the rest of the patients. If we keep him</p>
      <p>on the ward I am certain his brashness will subside, his self-made rebellion will dwindle to nothing,</p>
      <p>and”—she smiles, knowing something nobody else does—“that our redheaded hero will cut himself</p>
      <p>down to something the patients will all recognize and lose respect for: a braggart and a blowhard of</p>
      <p>the  type  who  may  climb  up  on  a  soapbox  and  shout  for  a  following,  the  way  we’ve  all  seen  Mr.</p>
      <p>Cheswick do, then back down the moment there is any real danger to him personally.”</p>
      <p>“Patient McMurphy”—the boy with the pipe feels he should try to defend his position and save</p>
      <p>face just a little bit “does not strike me as a coward.”</p>
      <p>I expect her to get mad, but she doesn’t; she just gives him that let’s-wait-and-see look and says,</p>
      <p>“I didn’t say he was exactly a coward, Mr. Gideon; oh, no. He’s simply very fond of someone. As a</p>
      <p>psychopath, he’s much too fond of a Mr. Randle Patrick McMurphy to subject him to any needless</p>
      <p>danger.” She gives the boy a smile that puts his pipe out for sure this time. “If we just wait for a</p>
      <p>while, our hero will—what is it you college boys say?—give up his bit? Yes?”</p>
      <p>[137] “But that may take weeks—” the boy starts.</p>
      <p>“We have weeks,” she says. She stands up, looking more pleased with herself than I’ve seen her</p>
      <p>look since McMurphy came to trouble her a week ago. “We have weeks, or months, or even years if</p>
      <p>need  be.  Keep  in  mind  that  Mr.  McMurphy  is  committed.  The  length  of  time  he  spends  in  this</p>
      <p>hospital is entirely up to us. Now, if there is nothing else ...”</p>

      <p>The way the Big Nurse acted so confident in that staff meeting, that worried me for a while, but</p>
      <p>it didn’t make any difference to McMurphy. All weekend, and the next week, he was just as hard on</p>
      <p>her and her black boys as he ever was, and the patients were loving it. He’d won his bet; he’d got the</p>
      <p>nurse’s goat the way he said he would, and had collected on it, but that didn’t stop him from going</p>
      <p>right ahead and acting like he always had, hollering up and down the hall, laughing at the black boys,</p>
      <p>frustrating the whole staff, even going so far as to step up to the Big Nurse in the hall one time and</p>
      <p>ask her, if she didn’t mind tellin’, just what was the actual inch-by-inch measurement on them great</p>
      <p>big of breasts that she did her best to conceal but never could. She walked right on past, ignoring</p>
      <p>him  just  like  she  chose  to  ignore  the  way  nature  had  tagged  her  with  those  outsized  badges  of</p>
      <p>femininity, just like she was above him, and sex, and everything else that’s weak and of the flesh.</p>
      <p>When  she  posted  work  assignments  on  the  bulletin  board,  and  he  read  that  she’d  given  him</p>
      <p>latrine duty, he went to her office and knocked on that window of hers and personally thanked her</p>
      <p>for the honor, and told her he’d think of her every time he swabbed out a urinal. She told him that</p>
      <p>wasn’t necessary; just do his work and that would be sufficient, thank you.</p>
      <p>The  most  work  he  did  on  them  was  to  run  a  brush  around  the  bowls  once  or  twice  apiece,</p>
      <p>singing  some  song  as  loud  as  he  could  in  time  to  the  swishing  brush;  then  he’d  splash  in  some</p>
      <p>Clorox and he’d be through. “That’s clean enough,” he’d tell the black boy who got after him for the</p>
      <p>way he hurried through his job, “maybe not clean enough for some people, but myself I plan to piss</p>
      <p>in  ‘em,  not  eat  lunch out  of  ‘em.”  And  when the Big  Nurse  gave  in  to  the black  boy’s  frustrated</p>
      <p>pleading  and  came  in  to  check  McMurphy’s  cleaning  assignment  personally,  she  brought  a  little</p>
      <p>compact mirror and she held it under the rim of the bowls. She walked along shaking her head and</p>
      <p>saying,  “Why,  this  is  an  outrage  …  an  outrage  …”  at  every  bowl.  McMurphy  sidled  right  along</p>
      <p>beside her, winking down his nose and saying in answer, “No; that’s a toilet bowl ... a toilet bowl.”</p>
      <p>[139] But she didn’t lose control again, or even act at all like she might. She would get after him</p>
      <p>about the toilets, using that same terrible, slow, patient pressure she used on everybody, as he stood</p>
      <p>there in front of her, looking like a little kid getting a bawling out, hanging his head, and the toe of</p>
      <p>one boot on top of the other, saying, “I try and try, ma’am, but I’m afraid I’ll never make my mark as</p>
      <p>head man of the crappers.”</p>
      <p>Once he wrote something on a slip of paper, strange writing that looked like a foreign alphabet,</p>
      <p>and stuck it up under one of those toilet bowl rims with a wad of gum; when she came to that toilet</p>
      <p>with her mirror she gave a short gasp at what she read reflected and dropped her mirror in the toilet.</p>
      <p>But she didn’t lose control. That doll’s face and that doll’s smile were ‘  forged in confidence. She</p>
      <p>stood up from the toilet bowl and gave him a look that would peel paint and told him it was his job</p>
      <p>to make the latrine cleaner, not dirtier.</p>
      <p>Actually, there wasn’t much cleaning of any kind getting done on the ward. As soon as it came</p>
      <p>time  in  the  afternoon  when  the  schedule  called  for  house  duties,  it  was  also  time  for the  baseball</p>
      <p>games to be on TV, and everybody went and lined the chairs up in front of the set and they didn’t</p>
      <p>move  out  of  them  until  dinner.  It  didn’t  make  any  difference  that  the  power  was  shut  off  in  the</p>
      <p>Nurses’  Station  and  we  couldn’t  see  a  thing  but  that  blank  gray  screen,  because  McMurphy’d</p>
      <p>entertain us for hours, sit and talk and tell all kinds of stories, like how he made a thousand dollars in</p>
      <p>one month driving truck for a gyppo outfit and then lost every penny of it to some Canadian in an</p>
      <p>ax-throwing contest, or how he and a buddy slick-tongued a guy into riding a brahma bull at a rodeo</p>
      <p>in  Albany,  into  riding  him  while  he  wore  a  blindfold:  “Not  the  bull,  I  mean,  the  guy  had  on  the</p>
      <p>blindfold.” They told the guy that the blindfold would keep him from getting dizzy when the bull</p>
      <p>went to  spinning; then,  when  they  got  a bandanna  wrapped  around  his  eyes to  where he  couldn’t</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>90</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>see, they set him on that bull backward. McMurphy told it a couple of times and slapped his thigh</p>
      <p>with  his  hat  and  laughed  everytime  he  remembered  it.  “Blindfolded  and  backwards  ...  And  I’m  a</p>
      <p>sonofagun if he didn’t stay the limit and won the purse. And I was second; if he’d been throwed I’d</p>
      <p>of  took  first  and  a  neat  little  purse. I  swear  the next  time  I pull  a  stunt  like  that  I’ll  blindfold  the</p>
      <p>damn bull instead.”</p>
      <p>Whack his leg and throw back his head and laugh and laugh, digging his thumb into the ribs of</p>
      <p>whoever was sitting next to him, trying to get him to laugh too.</p>
      <p>There was times that week when I’d hear that full-throttled [140] laugh, watch him scratching his</p>
      <p>belly  and  stretching  and  yawning  and  leaning  back  to  wink  at  whoever  he  was  joking  with,</p>
      <p>everything  coming  to  him  just  as  natural  as  drawing  breath,  and  I’d  quit  worrying  about  the  Big</p>
      <p>Nurse  and  the  Combine  behind  her.  I’d  think  he  was  strong  enough  being  his  own  self  that  he</p>
      <p>would never back down the way she was hoping he would. I’d think, maybe he truly is something</p>
      <p>extraordinary. He’s what he is, that’s it. Maybe that makes him strong enough, being what he is. The</p>
      <p>Combine hasn’t got to him in all these years; what makes that nurse think she’s gonna be able to do</p>
      <p>it in a few weeks? He’s not gonna let them twist him and manufacture him.</p>
      <p>And later, hiding in the latrine from the black boys, I’d take a look at my own self in the mirror</p>
      <p>and wonder how it was possible that anybody could manage such an enormous thing as being what</p>
      <p>he was. There’d be my face in the mirror, dark and hard with big, high cheekbones like the cheek</p>
      <p>underneath them had been hacked out with a hatchet, eyes all black and hard and mean-looking, just</p>
      <p>like Papa’s eyes or the eyes of all those tough, mean-looking Indians you see on TV, and I’d think,</p>
      <p>That ain’t me, that ain’t my face. It wasn’t even me when I was trying to be that face. I wasn’t even</p>
      <p>really me then; I was just being the way I looked, the way people wanted. It don’t seem like I ever</p>
      <p>have been me. How can McMurphy be what he is?</p>
      <p>I  was  seeing  him  different than  when  he  first  came  in;  I  was  seeing  more  to him than  just  big</p>
      <p>hands and red sideburns and a broken-nosed grin. I’d see him do things that didn’t fit with his face</p>
      <p>or  hands,  things  like  painting  a  picture  at  OT  with  real  paints  on  a  blank  paper  with  no  lines  or</p>
      <p>numbers anywhere on it to tell him where to paint, or like writing letters to somebody in a beautiful</p>
      <p>flowing hand. How could a man who looked like him paint pictures or write letters to people, or be</p>
      <p>upset and worried like I saw him once when he got a letter back? These were the kind of things you</p>
      <p>expected from Billy Bibbit or Harding. Harding had hands that looked like they should have done</p>
      <p>paintings, though they never did; Harding trapped his hands and forced them to work sawing planks</p>
      <p>for doghouses. McMurphy wasn’t like that. He hadn’t let what he looked like run his life one way or</p>
      <p>the other, any more than he’d let the Combine mill him into fitting where they wanted him to fit.</p>
      <p>I was seeing lots of things different. I figured the fog machine had broke down in the walls when</p>
      <p>they turned it up too high for that meeting on Friday, so now they weren’t able to [141] circulate fog</p>
      <p>and gas and foul up the way things looked. For the first time in years 1 was seeing people with none</p>
      <p>of that black outline they used to have, and one night I was even able to see out the windows.</p>
      <p>Like I explained, most nights before they ran me to bed they gave me this pill, knocked me out</p>
      <p>and  kept  me  out.  Or  if  something  went  haywire  with  the  dose  and  I  woke  up,  my  eyes  were  all</p>
      <p>crusted  over  and  the  dorm  was  full  of  smoke,  wires  in  the  walls  loaded  to  the  limit,  twisting  and</p>
      <p>sparking death and hate in the air—all too much for me to take so I’d ram my head under the pillow</p>
      <p>and try to get back to sleep. Every time I peeked back out there would be the smell of burning hair</p>
      <p>and a sound like sidemeat on a hot griddle.</p>
      <p>But  this one  night,  a  few  nights  after  the big  meeting,  I  woke  up  and the  dorm  was  clean  and</p>
      <p>silent; except for the soft breathing of the men and the stuff rattling around loose under the brittle</p>
      <p>ribs of the two old Vegetables, it was dead  quiet. A window was  up, and the air in the dorm was</p>
      <p>clear and had a taste to it made me feel kind of giddy and drunk, gave me this sudden yen to get up</p>
      <p>out of bed and do something.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>91</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>I slid from between the sheets and walked barefoot across the cold tile between the beds. I felt</p>
      <p>the tile with my feet and wondered how many times, how many thousand times, had I run a mop</p>
      <p>over  this  same  tile  floor  and  never  felt  it  at  all.  That  mopping  seemed  like  a  dream  to  me,  like  I</p>
      <p>couldn’t exactly believe all those years of it had really happened. Only that cold linoleum under my</p>
      <p>feet was real right then, only that moment.</p>
      <p>I walked among the guys heaped in long white rows like  snowbanks, careful not to bump into</p>
      <p>somebody, till I came to the wall with the windows. I walked down the windows to one where the</p>
      <p>shade popped softly in and out with the breeze, and I pressed my forehead up against the mesh. The</p>
      <p>wire was cold and sharp, and I rolled my head against it from side to side to feel it with my cheeks,</p>
      <p>and I smelled the breeze. It’s fall coming, I thought, I can smell that sour-molasses smell of silage,</p>
      <p>clanging  the  air  like  a  bell—smell  somebody’s  been  burning  oak  leaves,  left  them  to  smolder</p>
      <p>overnight because they’re too green.</p>
      <p>It’s fall coming, I kept thinking, fall coming; just like that was the strangest thing ever happened.</p>
      <p>Fall. Right outside here it was spring a while back, then it was summer, and now it’s fall—that’s sure</p>
      <p>a curious idea.</p>
      <p>I realized I still had my eyes shut. I had shut them when I put my face to the screen, like I was</p>
      <p>scared to look outside. Now I had to open them. I looked out the window and saw for [142] the first</p>
      <p>time how the hospital was out in the country. The moon was ‘low in the sky over the pastureland;</p>
      <p>the face of it was scarred and scuffed where it had just torn up out of the snarl of scrub oak and</p>
      <p>madrone  trees  on  the  horizon.  The  stars  up  close  to  the  moon  were  pale;  they  got  brighter  and</p>
      <p>braver the farther they got out of the circle of light ruled by the giant moon. It called to mind how I</p>
      <p>noticed the exact same thing when I was off on a hunt with Papa and the uncles and I lay rolled in</p>
      <p>blankets  Grandma had  woven,  lying  off  a piece  from  where the  men hunkered  around the  fire  as</p>
      <p>they passed  a  quart  jar  of  cactus  liquor  in  a  silent  circle.  I  watched that big  Oregon prairie  moon</p>
      <p>above me put all the stars around it to shame. I kept awake watching, to see if the moon ever got</p>
      <p>dimmer or if the stars got brighter, till the dew commenced to drift onto my cheeks and I had to pull</p>
      <p>a blanket over my head.</p>
      <p>Something moved on the grounds down beneath my window—cast a long spider of shadow out</p>
      <p>across the grass as it ran out of sight behind a hedge. When it ran back to where I could get a better</p>
      <p>look, I saw it was a dog, a young, gangly mongrel slipped off from home to find out about things</p>
      <p>went on after dark. He was sniffing digger squirrel holes, not with a notion to go digging after one</p>
      <p>but just to get an idea what they were up to at this hour. He’d run his muzzle down a hole, butt up</p>
      <p>in the air and tail going, then dash off to another. The moon glistened around him on the wet grass,</p>
      <p>and when he ran he left tracks like dabs of dark paint spattered across the blue shine of the lawn.</p>
      <p>Galloping  from  one  particularly  interesting  hole  to  the  next,  he  became  so  took  with  what  was</p>
      <p>coming  off—the  moon  up  there,  the  night,  the  breeze  full  of  smells  so  wild  makes  a  young  dog</p>
      <p>drunk—that he had to lie down on his back and roll. He twisted and thrashed around like a  fish,</p>
      <p>back bowed and belly up, and when he got to his feet and shook himself a spray came off him in the</p>
      <p>moon like silver scales.</p>
      <p>He sniffed all the holes over again one quick one, to get the smells down good, then suddenly</p>
      <p>froze  still  with  one  paw  lifted  and  his  head  tilted,  listening.  I  listened  too,  but  I  couldn’t  hear</p>
      <p>anything except the popping of the window shade. I listened for a long time. Then, from a long way</p>
      <p>off, I heard a high, laughing  gabble, faint and coming closer. Canada honkers going south for the</p>
      <p>winter.  I  remembered  all  the  hunting  and belly-crawling  I’d  ever  done trying to  kill  a  honker,  and</p>
      <p>that I never got one.</p>
      <p>I tried to look where the dog was looking to see if I could find the flock, but it was too dark. The</p>
      <p>honking came closer and [143] closer till it seemed like they must be flying right through the dorm,</p>
      <p>right over my head. Then they crossed the moon—a black, weaving necklace, drawn into a V by that</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>92</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>lead  goose.  For  an  instant  that  lead  goose  was  right  in  the  center  of  that  circle,  bigger  than  the</p>
      <p>others, a black cross opening and closing, then he pulled his V out of sight into the sky once more.</p>
      <p>I listened to them fade away till all I could hear was my memory of the sound. The dog could still</p>
      <p>hear them a long time after me. He was still standing with his paw up; he hadn’t moved or barked</p>
      <p>when they flew over. When he couldn’t hear them any more either, he commenced to lope off in the</p>
      <p>direction they had gone, toward the highway, loping steady and solemn like he had an appointment.</p>
      <p>I held my breath and I could hear the flap of his big paws on the grass as he loped; then I could hear</p>
      <p>a  car  speed  up  out  of  a  turn.  The  headlights  loomed  over  the  rise  and  peered  ahead  down  the</p>
      <p>highway. I watched the dog and the car making for the same spot of pavement.</p>
      <p>The dog was almost to the rail fence at the edge of the grounds when I felt somebody slip up</p>
      <p>behind me. Two people. I didn’t turn, but I knew it was the black boy named Geever and the nurse</p>
      <p>with the birthmark and the crucifix. I heard a whir of fear start up in my head. The black boy took</p>
      <p>my arm and pulled me around. “I’ll get ‘im,” he says.</p>
      <p>“It’s chilly at the window there, Mr. Bromden,” the nurse tells me. “Don’t you think we’d better</p>
      <p>climb back into our nice toasty bed?”</p>
      <p>“He cain’t hear,” the black boy tells her. “I’ll take him. He’s always untying his sheet and roaming</p>
      <p>‘round.”</p>
      <p>And I move and she draws back a step and says, “Yes, please do,” to the black boy. She’s fiddling</p>
      <p>with the chain runs down her neck. At home she locks herself in the bathroom out of sight, strips</p>
      <p>down, and rubs that crucifix all over that stain running from the corner of her mouth in a thin line</p>
      <p>down across her shoulders and breasts. She rubs and rubs and hails Mary to beat thunder, but the</p>
      <p>stain  stays.  She  looks  in  the mirror,  sees  it’s  darker’n  ever.  Finally  takes  a  wire  brush  used  to take</p>
      <p>paint off boats and scrubs the stain away, puts a nightgown on over the raw, oozing hide, and crawls</p>
      <p>in bed.</p>
      <p>But she’s too full of the stuff. While she’s asleep it rises in her throat and into her mouth, drains</p>
      <p>out of that corner of her mouth like purple spit and down her throat, over her body. In the morning</p>
      <p>she sees how she’s stained again and somehow she figures it’s not really from inside her—how could</p>
      <p>it  be?  a  good  Catholic  girl  like  her?—and  she  figures  it’s  on  account  of  [144]  working  evenings</p>
      <p>among a whole wardful of people like me. It’s all our fault, and she’s going to get us for it if it’s the</p>
      <p>last thing she does. I wish McMurphy’d wake up and help me.</p>
      <p>“You get him tied in bed, Mr. Geever, and I’ll prepare a medication.”</p>

      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>18</p>
      <p>In the group meetings there were gripes coming up that had been buried so long the thing being</p>
      <p>griped  about  had  already  changed.  Now  that  McMurphy  was  around  to  back  them  up,  the  guys</p>
      <p>started letting fly at everything that had ever happened on the ward they didn’t like.</p>
      <p>“Why does the dorms have to be locked on the weekends?” Cheswick or somebody would ask.</p>
      <p>“Can’t a fellow even have the weekends to himself?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, Miss Ratched,” McMurphy would say. “Why?”</p>
      <p>“If the dorms were left open, we have learned from past experience, you men would return to</p>
      <p>bed after breakfast.”</p>
      <p>“Is that a mortal sin? I mean, normal people get to sleep late on the weekends.”</p>
      <p>“You men are in this hospital,” she would say like she was repeating it for the hundredth time,</p>
      <p>“because of your proven inability to adjust to society. The doctor and I believe that every minute</p>
      <p>spent  in  the  company  of  others,  with  some  exceptions,  is  therapeutic,  while  every  minute  spent</p>
      <p>brooding alone only increases your separation.”</p>
      <p>“Is that the reason that there has to be at least eight guys together before they can be taken off</p>
      <p>the ward to OT or PT or one of them Ts?”</p>
      <p>“That is correct.”</p>
      <p>“You mean it’s sick to want to be off by yourself?”</p>
      <p>“I didn’t say that—”</p>
      <p>“You mean if I go into latrine to relieve myself I should take along at least seven buddies to keep</p>
      <p>me from brooding on the can?”</p>
      <p>Before she could come up with an answer to that, Cheswick bounced to his feet and hollered at</p>
      <p>her,  “Yeah,  is  that  what  you  mean?”  and  the  other  Acutes  sitting  around  the  meeting  would  say,</p>
      <p>“Yeah, yeah, is that what you mean?”</p>
      <p>She would wait till they all died down and the meeting was quiet again, then say quietly, “If you</p>
      <p>men can calm yourself enough to act like a group of adults at a discussion instead of children on the</p>
      <p>playground, we will ask the doctor if he thinks [146] it would be beneficial to consider a change in</p>
      <p>the ward policy at this time. Doctor?”</p>
      <p>Everybody knew the kind of answer the doctor would make, and before he even had the chance</p>
      <p>Cheswick would be off on another complaint. “Then what about our cigarettes, Miss Ratched?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, what about that,” the Acutes grumbled.</p>
      <p>McMurphy turned to the doctor and put the question straight to him this time before the nurse</p>
      <p>had  a  chance  to  answer.  “Yeah,  Doc,  what  about  our  cigarettes?  How  does  she  have  the  right  to</p>
      <p>keep the cigarettes—our cigarettes—piled up on her desk in there like she owned them, bleed a pack</p>
      <p>out  to  us  now  and  again  whenever  she  feels  like  it.  I  don’t care  much  about  the  idea  of buying  a</p>
      <p>carton of cigarettes and having somebody tell me when I can smoke them.”</p>
      <p>The  doctor  tilted  his  head  so  he  could  look  at  the  nurse  through  his  glasses.  He  hadn’t  heard</p>
      <p>about her taking over the extra cigarettes to stop the gambling. “What’s this about cigarettes, Miss</p>
      <p>Ratched? I don’t believe I’ve heard—”</p>
      <p>“I feel, Doctor, that three and four and sometimes five packages of cigarettes a day are entirely</p>
      <p>too  many  for  a  man  to  smoke.  That  is  what  seemed  to  be  happening  last  week—after  Mr.</p>
      <p>McMurphy’s arrival—and that is why I thought it  might be best to impound the cartons the men</p>
      <p>purchased at the canteen and allow each man only one pack a day.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy  leaned  forward  and  whispered  loudly  to  Cheswick,  “Hear  tell  her  next  decision  is</p>
      <p>about trips to the can; not only does a guy have to take his seven buddies into the latrine with him</p>
      <p>but he’s also limited to two trips a day, to be taken when she says so.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>94</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>And leaned back in his chair and laughed so hard that nobody else could say anything for nearly a</p>
      <p>minute.</p>
      <p>McMurphy was getting a lot of kick out of all the ruckus he was raising, and I think was a little</p>
      <p>surprised that he wasn’t getting a lot of pressure from the staff too, especially surprised that the Big</p>
      <p>Nurse wasn’t having any more to say to him than she was. “I thought the old buzzard was tougher</p>
      <p>than this,” he said to Harding after one meeting. “Maybe all she needed to straighten her out was a</p>
      <p>good  bringdown.  The  thing  is”—he  frowned—“she  acts  like  she  still  holds  all  the  cards  up  that</p>
      <p>white sleeve of hers.”</p>
      <p>He went on getting a kick out of it till about Wednesday of the next week. Then he learned why</p>
      <p>the Big Nurse was so sure of her hand. Wednesday’s the day they pack everybody up who hasn’t got</p>
      <p>some kind of rot and move to the swimming [147] pool, whether we want to go or not. When the</p>
      <p>fog was on the ward I used to hide in it to get out of going. The pool always scared me; I was always</p>
      <p>afraid I’d step in over my head and drown, be sucked off down the drain and clean out to sea. I used</p>
      <p>to be real brave around water when I was a kid on the Columbia; I’d walk the scaffolding around the</p>
      <p>falls with all the other men, scrambling around with water roaring green and white all around me and</p>
      <p>the mist making rainbows, without even any hobnails like the men wore. But when I saw my Papa</p>
      <p>start getting scared of things, I got scared too, got so I couldn’t even stand a shallow pool.</p>
      <p>We came out of the locker room and the pool was pitching and splashing and full of naked men;</p>
      <p>whooping and yelling bounced off the high ceiling the way it always does in indoor swimming pools.</p>
      <p>The black boys herded us into it. The water was a nice warm temperature but I didn’t want to get</p>
      <p>away from the side (the black boys walk along the edge with long bamboo poles to shove you away</p>
      <p>from  the  side  if  you  try  to  grab  on)  so  I  stayed  close  to  McMurphy  on  account  of  I  knew  they</p>
      <p>wouldn’t try to make him go into deep water if he didn’t want to.</p>
      <p>He  was  talking  to  the  lifeguard,  and  I  was  standing  a  few  feet  away.  McMurphy  must  of  been</p>
      <p>standing in a hole because he was having to tread water where I was just standing on the bottom.</p>
      <p>The lifeguard was standing on the edge of the pool; he had a whistle and a T-shirt on with his ward</p>
      <p>number on it. He and McMurphy had got to talking about the difference between hospital and jail,</p>
      <p>and McMurphy was saying how much better the hospital was. The lifeguard wasn’t so sure. I heard</p>
      <p>him  tell  McMurphy  that,  for  one  thing,  being  committed  ain’t  like  being  sentenced.  “You’re</p>
      <p>sentenced in a jail, and you got a date ahead of you when you know you’re gonna be turned loose,”</p>
      <p>he said.</p>
      <p>McMurphy stopped splashing around like he had been. He swam slowly to the edge of the pool</p>
      <p>and held there, looking up at the lifeguard. “And if you’re committed?” he asked after a pause.</p>
      <p>The lifeguard raised his shoulders in a musclebound shrug and tugged at the whistle around his</p>
      <p>neck. He was an old pro-footballer with cleat marks in his forehead, and every so often when he was</p>
      <p>off his ward a signal would click back of his eyes and his lips’d go to spitting numbers and he’d drop</p>
      <p>to all fours in a line stance and cut loose on some strolling nurse, drive a shoulder in her kidneys just</p>
      <p>in time to let the halfback shoot past through the hole behind him. That’s why he was up on [148]</p>
      <p>Disturbed; whenever he wasn’t lifeguarding he was liable to do something like that.</p>
      <p>He shrugged again at McMurphy’s question, then looked back and forth to see if any black boys</p>
      <p>were around, and knelt close to the edge of the pool. He held his arm out for McMurphy to look at.</p>
      <p>“You see this cast?”</p>
      <p>McMurphy looked at the big arm. “You don’t have a cast on that arm, buddy.”</p>
      <p>The lifeguard just grinned. “Well, that cast’s on there because I got a bad fracture in the last game</p>
      <p>with the Browns. I can’t get back in togs till the fracture knits and I get the cast off. The nurse on</p>
      <p>my ward tells me she’s curing the arm in secret. Yeah, man, she says if I go easy on that arm, don’t</p>
      <p>exert it or nothing, she’ll take the cast off and I can get back with the ball club.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>95</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>He  put  his  knuckles  on  the  wet  tile,  went  into  a  three-point  stance  to  test  how  the  arm  was</p>
      <p>coming along. McMurphy watched him a minute, then asked bow long he’d been waiting for them</p>
      <p>to  tell  him  his  arm  was  healed  so  he  could  leave  the  hospital.  The  lifeguard  raised  up  slowly  and</p>
      <p>rubbed his arm. He acted hurt that McMurphy had asked that, like he thought he was being accused</p>
      <p>of being soft and licking his wounds. “I’m committed,” he said. “I’d of left here before now if it was</p>
      <p>up  to  me.  Maybe  I  couldn’t  play  first  string,  with  this  bum  arm,  but  I  could  of  folded  towels,</p>
      <p>couldn’t  I?  I  could  of  done  something.  That  nurse  on  my  ward,  she  keeps  telling  the  doctor  I  ain’t</p>
      <p>ready. Not even to fold towels in the crummy old locker room, I ain’t ready.”</p>
      <p>He  turned  and  walked  over  to  his  lifeguard  chair,  climbed  up  the  chair  ladder  like  a  drugged</p>
      <p>gorilla,  and  peered  down  at  us,  his  lower  lip  pushed  way  out.  “I  was  picked  up  for  drunk  and</p>
      <p>disorderly, and I been here eight years and eight months,” he said.</p>
      <p>McMurphy pushed backward from the edge of the pool and trod water and thought this over:</p>
      <p>he’d had a six months’ sentence at the work farm with two months finished, four more to go—and</p>
      <p>four  more  months  was  the  most  he  wanted  to  spend  locked  up  any  place.  He’d  been  close  to  a</p>
      <p>month  in  this  nuthouse  and  it  might  be  a  lot  better  than  a  work  farm,  what  with  good  beds  and</p>
      <p>orange juice for breakfast, but it wasn’t better to the point that he’d want to spend a couple of years</p>
      <p>here.</p>
      <p>He swam over to the steps at the shallow end of the pool and sat there the rest of the period,</p>
      <p>tugging that little tuft of wool [149] at his throat and frowning. Watching him sitting there frowning</p>
      <p>all to himself, I remembered what the Big Nurse had said in the meeting, and I began to feel afraid.</p>
      <p>When they blew the whistle for us to leave the pool and we all were straggling toward the locker</p>
      <p>room,  we  ran  into  this  other  ward  coming  into  the  swimming  pool  for  their  period,  and  in  the</p>
      <p>footbath at the shower you had to go through was this one kid from the other ward. He had a big</p>
      <p>spongy  pink  head  and  bulgy  hips  and  legs—like  somebody’d  grabbed  a  balloon  full  of  water  and</p>
      <p>squeezed it in the middle—and he was lying on his side in the footbath, making noises like a sleepy</p>
      <p>seal. Cheswick and Harding helped him stand up, and he lay right back down in the footbath. The</p>
      <p>head bobbed around in the disinfectant. McMurphy watched them lift him standing again.</p>
      <p>“What the devil is he?” he asked.</p>
      <p>“He  has  hydrocephalus,”  Harding  told  him.  “Some  manner of  lymph  disorder,  I  believe.  Head</p>
      <p>fills up with liquid. Give us a hand helping him stand up.”</p>
      <p>They turned the kid loose, and he lay back down in the footbath again; the look on his face was</p>
      <p>patient and helpless and stubborn; his mouth sputtered and blew bubbles in the milky-looking water.</p>
      <p>Harding repeated his request to McMurphy to give them a hand, and he and Cheswick bent down to</p>
      <p>the kid again. McMurphy pushed past them and stepped across the kid into the shower.</p>
      <p>“Let him lay,” he said, washing himself down in the shower. “Maybe he don’t like deep water.”</p>
      <p>I could see it coming. The next day he surprised everybody on the ward by getting up early and</p>
      <p>polishing that latrine till it sparkled, and then went to work on the hall floors when the black boys</p>
      <p>asked him to. Surprised everybody but the Big Nurse; she acted like it was nothing surprising at all.</p>
      <p>And that afternoon in the meeting when Cheswick said that everybody’d agreed that there should</p>
      <p>be some kind of showdown on the cigarette situation, saying, “I ain’t no little kid to have cigarettes</p>
      <p>kept from me like cookies! We want something done about it, ain’t that right, Mack?” and waited for</p>
      <p>McMurphy to back him up, all he got was silence.</p>
      <p>He looked over at McMurphy’s corner. Everybody did. McMurphy was there, studying the deck</p>
      <p>of cards that slid in and out of sight in his hands. He didn’t even look up. It was awfully quiet; there</p>
      <p>was just that slap of greasy cards and Cheswick’s heavy breathing.</p>
      <p>“I want something done!” Cheswick suddenly yelled again. [150] “I ain’t no little kid!” He stamped</p>
      <p>his foot and looked around him like he was lost and might break out crying any minute. He clenched</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>96</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>both fists and held them at his chubby round chest. His fists made little pink balls against the green,</p>
      <p>and they were clenched so hard he was shaking.</p>
      <p>He never had looked big; he was short and too fat and had a bald spot in the back of his head</p>
      <p>that showed like a pink dollar, but standing there by himself in the center of the day room like that</p>
      <p>he looked tiny. He looked at McMurphy and got no look back, and went down the line of Acutes</p>
      <p>looking for help. Each time a man looked away and refused to back him up, and the panic on his</p>
      <p>face doubled. His looking finally came to a stop at the Big Nurse. He stamped his foot again.</p>
      <p>“I want something done! Hear me? I want something done! Something! Something! Some—”</p>
      <p>The two big black boys clamped his arms from behind, and the least one threw a strap around</p>
      <p>him. He sagged like he’d been punctured, and the two big ones dragged him up to Disturbed; you</p>
      <p>could hear the soggy bounce of him going up the steps. When they came back and sat down, the Big</p>
      <p>Nurse turned to the line of Acutes across the room and looked at them. Nothing had been said since</p>
      <p>Cheswick left.</p>
      <p>“Is there any more discussion,” she said, “on the rationing of cigarettes?”</p>
      <p>Looking down the canceled row of faces hanging against the wall across the room from me, my</p>
      <p>eyes  finally  came  to  McMurphy  in  his  chair  in  the  corner,  concentrating  on  improving  his  one-</p>
      <p>handed card cut ... and the white tubes in the ceiling begin to pump their refrigerated light again ... I</p>
      <p>can feel it, beams all the way into my stomach.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>After McMurphy doesn’t stand up for us any longer, some of the Acutes talk and say he’s still</p>
      <p>outsmarting  the  Big  Nurse,  say  that  he  got  word  she  was  about  to  send  him  to  Disturbed  and</p>
      <p>decided to toe the line a while, not give her any reason. Others figure he’s letting her relax, then he’s</p>
      <p>going to spring something new on her, something wilder and more ornery than ever. You can hear</p>
      <p>them talking in groups, wondering.</p>
      <p>But me, I know why. I heard him talk to the lifeguard. He’s finally getting cagey, is all. The way</p>
      <p>Papa finally did when he came to realize that he couldn’t beat that group from town who wanted the</p>
      <p>government to put in the dam because of the money and the work it would bring, and because it</p>
      <p>would  get  rid  of  the  village:  Let  that  tribe  of  fish  Injuns  take  their  stink  and  their  two  hundred</p>
      <p>thousand dollars the government is [151] paying them and go some place else with it! Papa had done</p>
      <p>the  smart  thing  signing  the  papers;  there  wasn’t  anything  to  gain  by  bucking  it.  The  government</p>
      <p>would of  got it anyhow, sooner or later; this way the tribe would get paid good. It was the smart</p>
      <p>thing. McMurphy was doing the smart thing. I could see that. He was giving in because it was the</p>
      <p>smartest  thing  to  do,  not  because  of  any  of  these  other  reasons  the  Acutes  were  making  up.  He</p>
      <p>didn’t say so, but I knew and 1 told myself it was the smart thing to do. I told myself that over and</p>
      <p>over: It’s safe. Like hiding. It’s the smart thing to do, nobody could say any different. I know what</p>
      <p>he’s doing.</p>
      <p>Then one morning all the Acutes know too, know his real reason for backing down and that the</p>
      <p>reasons they been making up were just lies to kid themselves. He never says a thing about the talk he</p>
      <p>had with the lifeguard, but they know. I figure the nurse broadcast this during the night along all the</p>
      <p>little  lines  in  the  dorm  floor,  because  they  know  all  at  once.  I  can  tell  by  the  way  they  look  at</p>
      <p>McMurphy that morning when he comes in to the day room. Not looking like they’re mad with him,</p>
      <p>or even disappointed, because they can understand as well as I can that the only way he’s going to</p>
      <p>get the Big Nurse to lift his commitment is by acting like she wants, but still looking at him like they</p>
      <p>wished things didn’t have to be this way.</p>
      <p>Even  Cheswick  could  understand  it  and  didn’t hold  anything  against  McMurphy  for  not  going</p>
      <p>ahead and making a big fuss over the cigarettes. He came back down from Disturbed on the same</p>
      <p>day  that  the nurse  broadcast  the  information  to  the  beds,  and he  told  McMurphy himself  that he</p>
      <p>could understand how he acted and that it was surely the sharpest thing to do, considering, and that</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>97</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>if he’d thought about Mack being committed he’d never have put him on the spot like he had the</p>
      <p>other day. He told McMurphy this while we were all being taken over to the swimming pool. But</p>
      <p>just as soon as we got to the pool he said he did wish something mighta been done, though, and dove</p>
      <p>into the water. And got his fingers stuck some way in the grate that’s over the drain at the bottom of</p>
      <p>the pool, and neither the big lifeguard nor McMurphy nor the two black boys could pry him loose,</p>
      <p>and by the time they got a screwdriver and undid the grate and brought Cheswick up, with the grate</p>
      <p>still clutched by his chubby pink and blue fingers, he was drowned.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>98</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>19</p>
      <p>Up ahead of me in the lunch line I see a tray sling in the air, a green plastic cloud raining milk and</p>
      <p>peas and vegetable soup. Sefelt’s jittering out of the line on one foot with his arms both up in the air,</p>
      <p>falls backward in a stiff arch, and the whites of his eyes come by me upside down. His head hits the</p>
      <p>tile  with  a  crack  like  rocks  under  water,  and  he  holds  the  arch,  like  a  twitching,  jerking  bridge.</p>
      <p>Fredrickson and Scanlon make a jump to help, but the big black boy shoves them back and grabs a</p>
      <p>flat  stick  out  of  his  back pocket,  got  tape  wrapped  around  it  and covered  with  a  brown  stain.  He</p>
      <p>pries Sefelt’s mouth open and shoves the stick between his teeth, and I hear the stick splinter with</p>
      <p>Sefelt’s  bite.  I  can  taste  the  slivers.  Sefelt’s  jerks  slow  down  and  get  more  powerful,  working  and</p>
      <p>building  up  to  big  stiff  kicks  that  lift  him  to  a  bridge,  then  falling—lifting  and  falling,  slower  and</p>
      <p>slower, till the Big Nurse comes in and stands over him and he melts limp all over the floor in a gray</p>
      <p>puddle.</p>
      <p>She folds her hands in front of her, might hold a candle, and looks down at what’s left of him</p>
      <p>oozing out of the cuffs of his pants and shirt. “Mr. Sefelt?” she says to the black boy.</p>
      <p>“Tha’s right—uhn.” The black boy is jerking to get his stick back. “Mistuh See-fel’.”</p>
      <p>“And Mr. Sefelt has been asserting he needs no more medication.” She nods her head, steps back a</p>
      <p>step out of the way of him spreading toward her white shoes. She raises her head and looks round</p>
      <p>her  at  the  circle  of  Acutes  that’ve  come  up  to  see.  She  nods  again  and  repeats,  “...  needs  no  more</p>
      <p>medication.” Her face is smiling, pitying, patient, and disgusted all at once—a trained expression.</p>
      <p>McMurphy’s never seen such a thing. “What’s he got wrong with him?” he asks.</p>
      <p>She  keeps  her  eye  on  the  puddle,  not  turning  to  McMurphy.  “Mr.  Sefelt  is  an  epileptic,  Mr.</p>
      <p>McMurphy.  This  means  he  may  be  subject  to  seizures  like  this  at  any  time  if  he  doesn’t  follow</p>
      <p>medical  advice.  He  knows  better.  We’d  told  him  this  would  happen  when  he  didn’t  take  his</p>
      <p>medication. Still, he will insist on acting foolish.”</p>
      <p>Fredrickson comes out of the line with his eyebrows bristling. [153] He’s a sinewy, bloodless guy</p>
      <p>with blond hair and stringy blond eyebrows and a long jaw, and he acts tough every so often the way</p>
      <p>Cheswick used to try to do—roar and rant and cuss out one of the nurses, say he’s gonna leave this</p>
      <p>stinkin’ place! They always let him yell and shake his fist till he quiets down, then ask him if you are</p>
      <p>through,  Mr.  Fredrickson,  we’ll  go  start  typing  the  release—then make  book  in  the  Nurses’  Station</p>
      <p>how  long  it’ll  be  till  he’s  tapping  at  the  glass  with  a  guilty  look  and  asking  to  apologize  and  how</p>
      <p>about just forgetting those hotheaded things he said, just pigeonhole those old forms for a day or so,</p>
      <p>okay?</p>
      <p>He steps up to the nurse, shaking his fist at her. “Oh, is that it? Is that it, huh? You gonna crucify</p>
      <p>old Seef just as if he was doing it to spite you or something?”</p>
      <p>She lays a comforting hand on his arm, and his fist unrolls.</p>
      <p>“It’s okay, Bruce. Your friend will be all right. Apparently he hasn’t been swallowing his Dilantin.</p>
      <p>I simply don’t know what he is doing with it.”</p>
      <p>She  knows  as  well  as  anybody;  Sefelt  holds  the  capsules  in  his  mouth  and  gives  them  to</p>
      <p>Fredrickson later. Sefelt doesn’t like to take them because of what he calls “disastrous side effects,”</p>
      <p>and Fredrickson likes a double dose because he’s scared to death of having a fit. The nurse knows</p>
      <p>this, you can tell by her voice, but to look at her there, so sympathetic and kind, you’d think she was</p>
      <p>ignorant of anything at all between Fredrickson and Sefelt.</p>
      <p>“Yeahhh,” says Fredrickson, but he can’t work his attack up again. “Yeah, well, you don’t need to</p>
      <p>act like it was as simple as just take the stuff or don’t take it. You know how Seef worries about what</p>
      <p>he  looks  like  and  how  women  think  he’s  ugly  and  all  that,  and  you  know  how  he  thinks  the</p>

      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“I know,” she says and touches his arm again. “He also blames his falling hair on the drug. Poor</p>
      <p>old fellow.”</p>
      <p>“He’s not that old!”</p>
      <p>“I know, Bruce. Why do you get so upset? I’ve never understood what went on between you and</p>
      <p>your friend that made you get so defensive!”</p>
      <p>“Well, heck, anyway!” he says and jams his fists in his pockets.</p>
      <p>The nurse bends over and brushes a little place clean on the floor and puts her knee on it and</p>
      <p>starts kneading Sefelt back to some shape. She tells the black boy to stay with the poor old fellow</p>
      <p>and she’ll go send a Gurney down for him; wheel him into the dorm and let him sleep the rest of the</p>
      <p>day. When she stands she gives Fredrickson a pat on the arm, and he grumbles, [154] “Yeah, I have</p>
      <p>to take Dilantin too, you know. That’s why I know what Seef has to face. I mean, that’s why I—well,</p>
      <p>heck—”</p>
      <p>“I understand, Bruce, what both of you must go through, but don’t you think anything is better</p>
      <p>than that?”</p>
      <p>Fredrickson looks where she points. Sefelt has pulled back halfway normal, swelling up and down</p>
      <p>with big wet, rattling breaths. There’s a punk-knot rising on the side of his head where he landed,</p>
      <p>and a red foam around the black boy’s stick where it goes into his mouth, and his eyes are beginning</p>
      <p>to roll back into the whites. His hands are nailed out to each side with the palms up and the fingers</p>
      <p>jerking open and shut, just the way I’ve watched men jerk at the Shock Shop strapped to the crossed</p>
      <p>table, smoke curling up out of the palms from the current. Sefelt and Fredrickson never been to the</p>
      <p>Shock Shop. They’re manufactured to generate their own voltage, store it in their spines and can be</p>
      <p>turned on remote from the steel door in the Nurses’ Station if they get out of line—be right in the</p>
      <p>best  part  of  a  dirty  joke  and  stiffen  like  the  jolt  hit  square  in  the  small  of  the  back.  It  saves  the</p>
      <p>trouble of taking them over to that room.</p>
      <p>The nurse gives Fredrickson’s arm a little shake like he’d gone to sleep, and repeats, “Even if you</p>
      <p>take into consideration the harmful effects of the medicine, don’t you think it’s better than that?”</p>
      <p>As he stares down at the floor, Fredrickson’s blond eyebrows are raised like he’s seeing for the</p>
      <p>first time just how he looks at least once a month. The nurse smiles and pats his arm and heads for</p>
      <p>the door, glares at the Acutes to shame them for gathering around watching such a thing; when she’s</p>
      <p>gone, Fredrickson shivers and tries to smile.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what I got mad at the old girl about—I mean, she didn’t do anything to give me a</p>
      <p>reason to blow up like that, did she?”</p>
      <p>It isn’t like he wants an answer; it’s more sort of realizing that he can’t put his finger on a reason.</p>
      <p>He shivers again and starts to slip back away from the group. McMurphy comes up and asks him in</p>
      <p>a low voice what is it they take?</p>
      <p>“Dilantin, McMurphy, an anti-convulsant, if you must know.”</p>
      <p>“Don’t it work or something?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, I guess it works all right—if you take it.”</p>
      <p>“Then what’s the sweat about taking it or not?”</p>
      <p>“Look,  if  you  must  know!  Here’s  the  dirty  sweat  about  taking  it.”  Fredrickson  reaches  up  and</p>
      <p>grabs his lower lip between [155] his thumb and finger, pulls it down to show gums ragged and pink</p>
      <p>and bloodless around long shiny teeth. “Your gungs,” he says, hanging onto the lip. “Dilantin gnakes</p>
      <p>your gungs rot. And a seizure gnakes you grit your teeth. And you—”</p>
      <p>There’s a noise on the floor. They look to where Sefelt is moaning and wheezing, just as the black</p>
      <p>boy draws two teeth out with his taped stick.</p>
      <p>Scanlon takes his tray and walks away from the bunch, saying, “Hell of a life. Damned if you do</p>
      <p>and damned if you don’t. Puts a man in one confounded bind, I’d say.”</p>

      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>McMurphy says, “Yeah, I see what you mean,” looking down into Sefelt’s gathering face. His face</p>
      <p>has commenced to take on that same haggard, puzzled look of pressure that the face on the floor</p>
      <p>has.</p>

      <p>Whatever it was went haywire in the mechanism, they’ve just about got it fixed again. The clean,</p>
      <p>calculated arcade movement is coming back: six-thirty out of bed, seven into the mess hall, eight the</p>
      <p>puzzles come out for the Chronics and the cards for the Acutes. in the Nurses’ Station I can see the</p>
      <p>white hands of the Big Nurse float over the controls.</p>

      <p>They  take  me  with the Acutes  sometimes,  and  sometimes  they  don’t.  They  take  me  once  with</p>
      <p>them over to the library and I walk over to the technical section, stand there looking at the titles of</p>
      <p>books  on  electronics,  books  I  recognize  from  that  year  I  went  to  college;  I  remember  inside  the</p>
      <p>books are full of schematic drawings and equations and theories—hard, sure, safe things.</p>
      <p>I want to look at one of the books, but I’m scared to. I’m scared to do anything. I feel like I’m</p>
      <p>floating in the dusty yellow air of the library, halfway to the bottom, halfway to the top. The stacks</p>
      <p>of books teeter above me, crazy, zig-zagging, running all different angles to one another. One shelf</p>
      <p>bends a little to the left, one to the right. Some of them are leaning over me, and I don’t see how the</p>
      <p>books keep from falling out. It goes up and up this way, clear out of sight, the rickety stacks nailed</p>
      <p>together with slats and two-by-fours, propped up with poles, leaning against ladders, on all sides of</p>
      <p>me. If I pulled one book out, lord knows what awful thing might result.</p>
      <p>I hear somebody walk in, and it’s one of the black boys from our ward and he’s got Harding’s</p>
      <p>wife with him. They’re talking and grinning to each other as they come into the library.</p>
      <p>“See here, Dale,” the black boy calls over to Harding where he’s reading a book, “look here who</p>
      <p>come to visit you. I tole her it wun’t visitin’ hours but you know she jus’ sweet-talk me into bringin’</p>
      <p>her  right on  over here  anyhow.”  He  leaves  her  standing  in  front of  Harding  and  goes  off,  saying</p>
      <p>mysteriously, “Don’t you forget now, you hear?”</p>
      <p>She blows the black boy a kiss, then turns to Harding, slinging her hips forward. “Hello, Dale.”</p>
      <p>“Honey,” he says, but he doesn’t make any move to take the couple of steps to her. He looks</p>
      <p>around him at everybody watching.</p>
      <p>She’s  as  tall  as  he  is.  She’s  got  on  high-heeled  shoes  and  is  carrying  a  black  purse,  not  by  the</p>
      <p>strap, but holding it the way you hold a book. Her fingernails are red as drops of blood against the</p>
      <p>shiny black patent-leather purse.</p>
      <p>“Hey, Mack,” Harding calls to McMurphy, who’s sitting across the room, looking at a book of</p>
      <p>cartoons. “If you’ll curtail [158] your literary pursuits a moment I’ll introduce you to my counterpart</p>
      <p>and Nemesis; I would be trite and say, ‘to my better half,’ but I think that phrase indicates some kind</p>
      <p>of basically equal division, don’t you?”</p>
      <p>He  tries  to  laugh,  and  his  two  slim  ivory  fingers  dip  into  his  shirt  pocket  for  cigarettes,  fidget</p>
      <p>around getting the last one from the package. The cigarette shakes as he places it between his lips.</p>
      <p>He and his wife haven’t moved toward each other yet.</p>
      <p>McMurphy heaves up out of his chair and pulls his cap off as he walks over. Harding’s wife looks</p>
      <p>at him and smiles, lifting one of her eyebrows. “Afternoon, Miz Harding,” McMurphy says.</p>
      <p>She smiles back bigger than before and says, “I hate Mrs. Harding, Mack; why don’t you call me</p>
      <p>Vera?”</p>
      <p>They all three sit back down on the couch where Harding was sitting, and he tells his wife about</p>
      <p>McMurphy  and  how  McMurphy  got  the  best  of  the  Big  Nurse,  and  she  smiles  and  says  that  it</p>
      <p>doesn’t surprise her a bit. While Harding’s telling the story he gets enthusiastic and forgets about his</p>
      <p>hands, and they weave the air in front of him into a picture clear enough to see, dancing the story to</p>
      <p>the tune of his voice like two beautiful ballet women in white. His hands can be anything. But as</p>
      <p>soon as the story’s finished he notices McMurphy and his wife are watching the hands, and he traps</p>
      <p>them between his knees. He laughs about this, and his wife says to him, “Dale, when are you going</p>
      <p>to learn to laugh instead of making that mousy little squeak?”</p>
      <p>It’s the same thing that McMurphy said about Harding’s laugh on that first day, but it’s different</p>
      <p>somehow; where McMurphy saying it calmed Harding down, her saying it makes him more nervous</p>
      <p>than ever.</p>

      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>She asks for a cigarette, and Harding dips his fingers in his pocket again and it’s empty. “We’ve</p>
      <p>been  rationed,”  he  says,  folding  his  thin  shoulders  forward  like  he  was  trying  to  hide  the  half-</p>
      <p>smoked cigarette he was holding, “to one pack a day. That doesn’t seem to leave a man any margin</p>
      <p>for chivalry, Vera my dearest.”</p>
      <p>“Oh Dale, you never do have enough, do you?”</p>
      <p>His  eyes  take  on  that  sly,  fevered  skittishness  as  he  looks  at  her  and  smiles.  “Are  we  speaking</p>
      <p>symbolically, or are we still dealing with the concrete here-and-now cigarettes? No matter; you know</p>
      <p>the answer to the question, whichever way you intended it.”</p>
      <p>“I didn’t intend nothing by it except what I said, Dale—”</p>
      <p>[159] “You didn’t intend anything by it, sweetest; your use of ‘didn’t’ and ‘nothing’ constitutes a</p>
      <p>double negative. McMurphy, Vera’s English rivals yours for illiteracy. Look, honey, you understand</p>
      <p>that between ‘no’ and ‘any’ there is—”</p>
      <p>“All right! That’s enough! I meant it both ways. I meant it any way you want to take it. I meant</p>
      <p>you don’t have enough of nothing period!”</p>
      <p>“Enough of anything, my bright little child.”</p>
      <p>She  glares  at  Harding  a  second,  then  turns  to  McMurphy  sitting  beside  her.  “You, Mack,  what</p>
      <p>about you. Can you handle a simple little thing like offering a girl a cigarette?”</p>
      <p>His  package  is  already  lying  in  his  lap.  He  looks  down  at  it  like  he  wishes  it  wasn’t,  then  says,</p>
      <p>“Sure, I always got cigarettes. Reason is, I’m a bum. I bum them whenever I get the chance is why</p>
      <p>my pack lasts longer than Harding’s here. He smokes only his own. So you can see he’s more likely</p>
      <p>to run out than—”</p>
      <p>“You don’t have to apologize for my inadequacies, my friend. It neither fits your character nor</p>
      <p>complements mine.”</p>
      <p>“No, it doesn’t,” the girl says. “All you have to do is light my cigarette.”</p>
      <p>And she leans so far forward to his match that even clear across the room I could see down her</p>
      <p>blouse.</p>
      <p>She  talks  some  more  about  some  of  Harding’s  friends  who  she  wishes  would  quit  dropping</p>
      <p>around  the house  looking  for  him.  “You  know  the  type,  don’t  you,  Mack?”  she  says.  “The  hoity-</p>
      <p>toity boys with the nice long hair combed so perfectly and the limp little wrists that flip so nice.”</p>
      <p>Harding asks her if it was only him that they were dropping around to see, and she says any man</p>
      <p>that drops around to see her flips more than his damned limp wrists.</p>
      <p>She stands suddenly and says it’s time for her to go. She takes McMurphy’s hand and tells him</p>
      <p>she  hopes  she  sees  him  again  sometime  and  she  walks  out  of  the  library.  McMurphy  can’t  say  a</p>
      <p>word.  At  the  clack  of  her  high  heels  everybody’s  head  comes  up  again,  and  they  watch  her  walk</p>
      <p>down the hall till she turns out of sight.</p>
      <p>“What do you think?” Harding says.</p>
      <p>McMurphy  starts.  “She’s  got one hell  of  a  set  of  chabobs,”  is  all  he  can  think  of.  “Big  as  Old</p>
      <p>Lady Ratched’s.”</p>
      <p>“I didn’t mean physically, my friend, I mean what do you—”</p>
      <p>“Hell’s  bells,  Harding!”  McMurphy  yells  suddenly.  “I  don’t  know  what  to  think!  What  do  you</p>
      <p>want out of me? A marriage counsellor? All I know is this: nobody’s very big in the first place, and it</p>
      <p>looks to me like everybody spends their whole life tearing everybody else down. I know what you</p>
      <p>want  me  to  [160]  think;  you  want  me  to  feel  sorry  for  you,  to  think  she’s  a  real  bitch.  Well,  you</p>
      <p>didn’t make her feel like any queen either. Well, screw you and ‘what do you think?’ I’ve got worries</p>
      <p>of  my  own  without  getting  hooked  with  yours.  So  just  quit!”  He  glares  around  the  library  at  the</p>
      <p>other patients. “Alla you! Quit bugging me, goddammit!”</p>
      <p>And sticks his cap back on his head and walks back to his cartoon magazine across the room. All</p>
      <p>the  Acutes  are  looking  at  each  other  with  their  mouths  open.  What’s  he  hollering  at  them  about?</p>

      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>Nobody’s  been  bugging  him.  Nobody’s  asked  him  for  a  thing  since  they  found  out  that  he  was</p>
      <p>trying to behave to keep his commitment from being extended. Now they’re surprised at the way he</p>
      <p>just blew up at Harding and can’t figure the way he grabs the book up from the chair and sits down</p>
      <p>and  holds  it  up  close  in  front of  his  face—either to  keep  people  from  looking  at  him  or  to  keep</p>
      <p>from having to look at people.</p>
      <p>That night at supper he apologizes to Harding and says he don’t know what hung him up so at</p>
      <p>the  library.  Harding  says  perhaps  it  was  his  wife;  she  frequently  hangs  people  up.  McMurphy  sits</p>
      <p>staring into his coffee and says, “I don’t know, man. I just met her this afternoon. So she sure the</p>
      <p>hell isn’t the one’s been giving me bad dreams this last miserable week.”</p>
      <p>“Why, Mis-tur McMurphy,” Harding cries, trying to talk like the little resident boy who comes to</p>
      <p>the meetings, “you simply must tell us about these dreams. Ah, wait until I get my pencil and pad.”</p>
      <p>Harding is trying to be funny to relieve the strain of the apology. He picks up a napkin and a spoon</p>
      <p>and  acts  like  he’s  going  to  take  notes.    “Now.  Pre-cisely,  what  was  it  you  saw  in  these—ah—</p>
      <p>dreams?”</p>
      <p>McMurphy don’t crack a smile. “I don’t know, man. Nothing but faces, I guess—just faces.”</p>

      <p>Spins a dial, shoves a lever forward and leans with the bank of the ship. He cranks a needle to</p>
      <p>“ON FULL” at the side of the panel, but no water comes out of the nozzles set around the square tile</p>
      <p>booth in front of him. They don’t use hydrotherapy any more, and nobody’s turned the water on.</p>
      <p>Brand-new  chrome  equipment  and  steel  panel  never  been  used.  Except  for the  chrome the panel</p>
      <p>and shower look just like the [161] hydrotherapy outfits they used at the old hospital fifteen years</p>
      <p>ago: nozzles capable of reaching parts of the body from every angle, a technician in a rubber apron</p>
      <p>standing  on  the  other  side  of  the  room  manipulating  the  controls  on  that  panel,  dictating  which</p>
      <p>nozzles squirt where, how hard, how hot—spray opened soft and soothing, then squeezed sharp as a</p>
      <p>needle-you hung up there between the nozzles in canvas straps, soaked and limp and wrinkled while</p>
      <p>the technician enjoyed his toy.</p>
      <p>“EeeeaaooOOOoommm. ... Air to ground, air to ground: missile sighted; coming into my sights</p>
      <p>now. ...</p>
      <p>Martini bends down and aims over the panel through the ring of nozzles. He closes one eye and</p>
      <p>peeps through the ring with the other eye.</p>
      <p>“On target! Ready … Aim ... Fi—!”</p>
      <p>His hands jerk back from the panel and he stands bolt upright, hair flying and both eyes bulging</p>
      <p>out at the shower booth so wild and scared all the card-players spin around in their chairs to see if</p>
      <p>they can see it too—but they don’t see anything in there but the buckles hanging among the nozzles</p>
      <p>on stiff new canvas straps.</p>
      <p>Martini turns and looks straight at McMurphy. No one else. “Didn’t you see thum? Didn’t you?”</p>
      <p>“See who, Mart? I don’t see anything.”</p>
      <p>“In all those straps? Didn’t you?”</p>
      <p>McMurphy turns and squints at the shower. “Nope. Not a thing.”</p>
      <p>“Hold it a minute. They need you to see thum,” Martini says.</p>
      <p>“Damn you, Martini, I told you I can’t see them! Understand? Not a blessed thing!”</p>
      <p>“Oh,” Martini says. He nods his head and turns from the shower booth. “Well, I didn’t see thum</p>
      <p>either. I’s just kidding you.”</p>

      <p>I remember it was a Friday again, three weeks after we voted on TV, and everybody who could</p>
      <p>walk was herded over to Building One for what they try to tell us is chest X-rays for TB, which I</p>
      <p>know is a check to see if everybody’s machinery is functioning up to par.</p>
      <p>We’re benched in a long row down a bail leading to a door marked X-RAY. Next to X-ray is  a</p>
      <p>door  marked  EENT  where  they  check  our  throats  during  the  winter.  Across  the  hall  from  us  is</p>
      <p>another bench, and it leads to that metal door. With the line of rivets. And nothing marked on it at</p>
      <p>all. Two guys are dozing on the bench between two black boys, while another victim inside is getting</p>
      <p>his treatment and I can hear him screaming. The door opens inward with a whoosh, and I can see</p>
      <p>the twinkling tubes in the room. They wheel the victim out still smoking, and I grip the bench where</p>
      <p>I  sit  to  keep  from being  sucked  through  that  door.  A  black  boy  and  a  white one  drag  one  of  the</p>
      <p>other guys on the bench to his feet, and he sways and staggers under the drugs in him. They usually</p>
      <p>give you red capsules before Shock. They push him through the door, and the technicians get him</p>
      <p>under each arm. For a second I see the guy realizes where they got him, and he stiffens both heels</p>
      <p>into the cement floor to keep from being pulled to the table—then the door pulls  shut, phumph,</p>
      <p>with metal hitting a mattress, and I can’t see him any more.</p>
      <p>“Man, what they got going on in there?” McMurphy asks Harding.</p>
      <p>“In there? Why, that’s right, isn’t it? You haven’t had the pleasure. Pity. An experience no human</p>
      <p>should be without.” Harding laces his fingers behind his neck and leans back to look at the door.</p>
      <p>“That’s the Shock Shop I was telling you about some time back, my friend, the EST, Electro-Shock</p>
      <p>Therapy.  Those  fortunate  souls  in  there  are  being  given  a  free  trip  to  the  moon.  No,  on  second</p>
      <p>thought,  it  isn’t  completely  free.  You  pay  for  the  service  with  brain  cells  instead  of  money,  and</p>
      <p>everyone has simply billions of brain cells on deposit. You won’t miss a few.”</p>
      <p>He  frowns  at  the  one  lone  man  left  on  the  bench.  “Not  a  very  large  clientele  today,  it  seems,</p>
      <p>nothing like the crowds [163] of yesteryear. But then, c’est la vie, fads come and go. And I’m afraid we</p>
      <p>are witnessing the sunset of EST. Our dear head nurse is one of the few with the heart to stand up</p>
      <p>for a grand old Faulknerian tradition in the treatment of the rejects of sanity: Brain Burning.”</p>
      <p>The  door  opens.  A  Gurney  comes  whirring  out,  nobody  pushing  it,  takes  the  corner  on  two</p>
      <p>wheels and disappears smoking up the hall. McMurphy watches them take the last guy in and close</p>
      <p>the door.</p>
      <p>“What they do is”—McMurphy listens a moment—“take some bird in there and shoot electricity</p>
      <p>through his skull?”</p>
      <p>“That’s a concise way of putting it.”</p>
      <p>“What the hell for?”</p>
      <p>“Why,  the  patient’s  good,  of  course.  Everything  done  here  is  for  the  patient’s  good.  You  may</p>
      <p>sometimes  get  the  impression,  having  lived  only  on  our  ward,  that  the  hospital  is  a  vast  efficient</p>
      <p>mechanism that would function quite well if the patient were not imposed on it, but that’s not true.</p>
      <p>EST  isn’t  always  used  for  punitive  measures,  as  our  nurse  uses  it,  and  it  isn’t  pure  sadism  on  the</p>
      <p>staff’s part, either. A number of supposed Irrecoverables were brought back into contact with shock,</p>
      <p>just as a number were helped with lobotomy and leucotomy. Shock treatment has some advantages;</p>
      <p>it’s cheap, quick, entirely painless. It simply induces a seizure.”</p>
      <p>“What a life,” Sefelt moans. “Give some of us pills to stop a fit, give the rest shock to start one.”</p>
      <p>Harding leans forward to explain it to McMurphy. “Here’s how it came about: two psychiatrists</p>
      <p>were visiting a slaughterhouse, for God knows what perverse reason, and were watching cattle being</p>
      <p>killed by a blow between the eyes with a sledgehammer. They noticed that not all of the cattle were</p>
      <p>killed, that some would fall to the floor in a state that greatly resembled an epileptic convulsion. ‘Ah,</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>107</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>zo,’ the first doctor says. ‘Ziz is exactly vot ve need for our patients—zee induced fit!’ His colleague</p>
      <p>agreed, of course. It was known that men coming out of an epileptic convulsion were inclined to be</p>
      <p>calmer and more peaceful for a time, and that violent cases completely out of contact were able to</p>
      <p>carry  on  rational  conversations  after  a  convulsion.  No  one  knew  why;  they  still  don’t.  But  it  was</p>
      <p>obvious that if a seizure could be induced in non-epileptics, great benefits might result. And here,</p>
      <p>before them, stood a man inducing seizures every so often with remarkable aplomb.”</p>
      <p>Scanlon  says  he  thought  the  guy  used  a  hammer  instead  of  a  bomb,  but  Harding  says  he  will</p>
      <p>ignore  that  completely,  and  he  goes  ahead  with  the  explanation.  [164]  “A  hammer  is  what  the</p>
      <p>butcher  used.  And  it  was  here  that the  colleague  had  some reservations.  After  all,  a  man  wasn’t  a</p>
      <p>cow.  Who  knows  when  the  hammer  might  slip  and  break  a nose?  Even  knock out  a mouthful  of</p>
      <p>teeth? Then where would they be, with the high cost of dental work? If they were going to knock a</p>
      <p>man in the head, they needed to use something surer and more accurate than a hammer; they finally</p>
      <p>settled on electricity.”</p>
      <p>“Jesus, didn’t they think it might do some damage? Didn’t the public raise Cain about it?”</p>
      <p>“I don’t think you fully understand the public, my friend; in this country, when something is out</p>
      <p>of order, then the quickest way to get it fixed is the best way.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy shakes his head. “Hoo-wee! Electricity through the head. Man, that’s like electrocuting</p>
      <p>a guy for murder.”</p>
      <p>“The  reasons  for  both  activities  are  much  more  closely  related  than  you  might  think;  they  are</p>
      <p>both cures.”</p>
      <p>“And you say it don’t hurt?”</p>
      <p>“I  personally  guarantee  it.  Completely painless.  One  flash  and  you’re  unconscious  immediately.</p>
      <p>No gas, no needle, no sledgehammer. Absolutely painless. The thing is, no one ever wants another</p>
      <p>one. You … change. You forget things. It’s as if”—he presses his hands against his temples, shutting</p>
      <p>his  eyes—“it’s  as  if  the  jolt  sets  off  a  wild  carnival  wheel  of  images,  emotions,  memories.  These</p>
      <p>wheels,  you’ve  seen  them;  the  barker  takes  your  bet  and  pushes  a  button.  Chang!  With  light  and</p>
      <p>sound and numbers round and round in a whirlwind, and maybe you win with what you end up with</p>
      <p>and maybe you lose and have to play again. Pay the man for another spin, son, pay the man.”</p>
      <p>“Take it easy, Harding.”</p>
      <p>The door opens and the Gurney comes back out with the guy under a sheet, and the technicians</p>
      <p>go out for coffee. McMurphy runs his hand through his hair. “I don’t seem able to get all this stuff</p>
      <p>that’s happening straight in my mind.”</p>
      <p>“What’s that? This shock treatment?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah. No, not just that. All this ...” He waves his hand in a circle. “All these things going on.”</p>
      <p>Harding’s  hand  touches  McMurphy’s  knee.  “Put  your  troubled  mind  at  ease,  my  friend.  In  all</p>
      <p>likelihood  you  needn’t  concern  yourself  with  EST.  It’s  almost  out  of  vogue  and  only  used  in  the</p>
      <p>extreme cases nothing else seems to reach, like lobotomy.”</p>
      <p>“Now lobotomy, that’s chopping away part of the brain?”</p>
      <p>“You’re right again. You’re becoming very sophisticated in [165] the jargon. Yes; chopping away</p>
      <p>the brain. Frontal-lobe castration. I guess if she can’t cut below the belt she’ll do it above the eyes.”</p>
      <p>“You mean Ratched.”</p>
      <p>“I do indeed.”</p>
      <p>“I didn’t think the nurse had the say—so on this kind of thing.”</p>
      <p>“She does indeed.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy acts like he’s glad to get off talking about shock and lobotomy and get back to talking</p>
      <p>about the Big Nurse. He asks Harding what he figures is wrong with her. Harding and Scanlon and</p>
      <p>some of the others have all kinds of ideas. They talk for a while about whether she’s the root of all</p>
      <p>the trouble here or not, and Harding says she’s the root of most of it. Most of the other guys think</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>108</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>so too, but McMurphy isn’t so sure any more. He says he thought so at one time but now he don’t</p>
      <p>know. He says he don’t think getting her out of the way would really make much difference; he says</p>
      <p>that there’s something bigger making all this mess and goes on to try to say what he thinks it is. He</p>
      <p>finally gives up when he can’t explain it.</p>
      <p>McMurphy doesn’t know it, but he’s onto what I realized a long time back, that it’s not just the</p>
      <p>Big  Nurse  by  herself,  but  it’s  the  whole  Combine,  the  nation-wide  Combine  that’s  the  really  big</p>
      <p>force, and the nurse is just a high-ranking official for them.</p>
      <p>The guys don’t agree with McMurphy. They say they know what the trouble with things is, then</p>
      <p>get in an argument about that. They argue till McMurphy interrupts them.</p>
      <p>“Hell’s bells, listen at you,” McMurphy says. “All I hear is gripe, gripe, gripe. About the nurse or</p>
      <p>the  staff  or  the  hospital.  Scanlon  wants  to  bomb  the  whole  outfit.  Sefelt  blames  the  drugs.</p>
      <p>Fredrickson blames his family trouble. Well, you’re all just passing the buck.”</p>
      <p>He says that the Big Nurse is just a bitter, icy-hearted old woman, and all this business trying to</p>
      <p>get  him  to  lock  horns  with  her  is  a  lot  of  bull—wouldn’t  do  anybody  any  good,  especially  him.</p>
      <p>Getting shut of her wouldn’t be getting shut of the real deep-down hang-up that’s causing the gripes.</p>
      <p>“You think not?” Harding says. “Then since you are suddenly so lucid on the problem of mental</p>
      <p>health, what is this trouble? What is this deep-down hang-up, as you so cleverly put it.”</p>
      <p>“I tell you, man, I don’t know. I never seen the beat of it.” He sits still for a minute, listening to</p>
      <p>the hum from the X-ray [166] room; then he says, “But if it was no more’n you say, if it was, say, just</p>
      <p>this old nurse and her sex worries, then the solution to all your problems would be to just throw her</p>
      <p>down and solve her worries, wouldn’t it?”</p>
      <p>Scanlon claps his hands. “Hot damn! That’s it. You’re nominated, Mack, you’re just the stud to</p>
      <p>handle the job.”</p>
      <p>“Not me. No sir. You got the wrong boy.”</p>
      <p>“Why not? I thought you’s the super-stud with all that whambam.”</p>
      <p>“Scanlon, buddy, I plan to stay as clear of that old buzzard as I possibly can.”</p>
      <p>“So I’ve been noticing,” Harding says, smiling. “What’s happened between the two of you? You</p>
      <p>had  her  on  the  ropes  for  a  period  there;  then  you  let  up.  A  sudden  compassion  for  our  angel  of</p>
      <p>mercy?”</p>
      <p>“No; I found out a few things, that’s why. Asked around some different places. I found out why</p>
      <p>you guys all kiss her ass so much and bow and scrape and let her walk all over you. I got wise to</p>
      <p>what you were using me for.”</p>
      <p>“Oh? That’s interesting.”</p>
      <p>“You’re blamed right it’s interesting. It’s interesting to me that you bums didn’t tell me what a</p>
      <p>risk I was running, twisting her tail that way. Just because I don’t like her ain’t a sign I’m gonna bug</p>
      <p>her into adding another year or so to my sentence. You got to swallow your pride sometimes and</p>
      <p>keep an eye out for old Number One.”</p>
      <p>“Why,  friends,  you  don’t  suppose  there’s  anything  to  this  rumor  that  our  Mr.  McMurphy  has</p>
      <p>conformed to policy merely to aid his chances of an early release?”</p>
      <p>“You  know  what  I’m  talking  about,  Harding.  Why  didn’t  you  tell  me  she  could  keep  me</p>
      <p>committed in here till she’s good and ready to turn me loose?”</p>
      <p>“Why, I had forgotten you were committed.” Harding’s face folds in the middle over his grin. “Yes.</p>
      <p>You’re becoming sly. Just like the rest of us.”</p>
      <p>“You damn betcha I’m becoming sly. Why should  it be me goes to bat at these meetings over</p>
      <p>these piddling  little  gripes  about  keeping  the  dorm  door  open  and  about cigarettes  in the Nurses’</p>
      <p>Station? I couldn’t figure it at first, why you guys were coming to me like I was some kind of savior.</p>
      <p>Then  I  just  happened  to  find  out  about  the  way  the  nurses  have  the  big  say  as  to  who  gets</p>
      <p>discharged and who doesn’t. And I got wise awful damned fast. I said, ‘Why, those slippery bastards</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>109</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>have  conned  me,  snowed  me  into  holding  their  bag.  If  that  don’t  beat  all,  conned  ol’  R.  P.</p>
      <p>McMurphy.’ “ He tips his head [167] back and grins at the line of us on the bench. “Well, I don’t</p>
      <p>mean  nothing  personal,  you  understand, buddies,  but  screw  that noise.  I  want out  of  here  just  as</p>
      <p>much as the rest of you. I got just as much to lose hassling that old buzzard as you do.”</p>
      <p>He grins and winks down his nose and digs Harding in the ribs with his thumb, like he’s finished</p>
      <p>with the whole thing but no hard feelings, when Harding says something else.</p>
      <p>“No. You’ve got more to lose than I do, my friend.”</p>
      <p>Harding’s grinning again, looking with that skitterish sideways look of a jumpy mare, a dipping,</p>
      <p>rearing  motion  of the  head. Everybody moves  down  a  place.  Martini  comes  away  from  the  X-ray</p>
      <p>screen,  buttoning  his  shirt  and  muttering,  “I  wouldn’t  of  believed  it  if  I  hadn’t  saw  it,”  and  Billy</p>
      <p>Bibbit goes to the black glass to take Martini’s place.</p>
      <p>“You have more to lose than I do,” Harding says again. “I’m voluntary. I’m not committed.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy doesn’t say a word. He’s got that same puzzled look on his face like there’s something</p>
      <p>isn’t right, something he can’t put his finger on. He just sits there looking at Harding, and Harding’s</p>
      <p>rearing  smile  fades  and  he  goes  to  fidgeting  around  from  McMurphy  staring  at him  so  funny.  He</p>
      <p>swallows and says, “As a matter of fact, there are only a few men on the ward who are committed.</p>
      <p>Only Scanlon and—well, I  guess some of the Chronics. And you. Not many commitments in the</p>
      <p>whole hospital. No, not many at all.”</p>
      <p>Then he stops, his voice dribbling away under McMurphy’s eyes. After a bit of silence McMurphy</p>
      <p>says  softly,  “Are  you  bullshitting  me?”  Harding  shakes  his  head.  He  looks  frightened.  McMurphy</p>
      <p>stands up in the hall and says, “Are you guys bullshitting me!”</p>
      <p>Nobody’ll say anything. McMurphy walks up and down in front of that bench, running his hand</p>
      <p>around in that thick hair. He walks all the way to the back of the line, then all the way to the front,</p>
      <p>to the X-ray machine. It hisses and spits at him.</p>
      <p>“You, Billy—you must be committed, for Christsakes!”</p>
      <p>Billy’s got his back to us, his chin up on the black screen, standing on tiptoe. No, he says into the</p>
      <p>machinery.</p>
      <p>“Then why? Why? You’re just a young guy! You oughta be out running around in a convertible,</p>
      <p>bird-dogging girls. All of this”—he sweeps his hand around him again—”why do you stand for it?”</p>
      <p>Billy doesn’t say anything, and McMurphy turns from him to another couple of guys.</p>
      <p>“Tell me why. You gripe, you bitch for weeks on end about [168] how you can’t stand this place,</p>
      <p>can’t stand the nurse or anything about her, and all the time you ain’t committed. I can understand it</p>
      <p>with some of those old guys on the ward. They’re nuts. But you, you’re not exactly the everyday man</p>
      <p>on the street, but you’re not nuts.”</p>
      <p>They don’t argue with him. He moves on to Sefelt.</p>
      <p>“Sefelt, what about you? There’s nothing wrong with you but you have fits. Hell, I had an uncle</p>
      <p>who threw conniptions twice as bad as yours and saw visions from the Devil to boot, but he didn’t</p>
      <p>lock himself in the nuthouse. You could get along outside if you had the guts—”</p>
      <p>“Sure!” It’s Billy, turned from the screen, his face boiling tears. “Sure!” he screams again. “If we</p>
      <p>had the g-guts! I could go outside to-today, if I had the guts. My m-m-mother is a good friend of M-</p>
      <p>Miss Ratched, and I could get an AMA signed this afternoon, if I had the guts!”</p>
      <p>He jerks his shirt up from the bench and tries to pull it on, but he’s shaking too hard. Finally he</p>
      <p>slings it from him and turns back to McMurphy.</p>
      <p>“You  think  I  wuh-wuh-wuh-want  to  stay  in  here?  You  think  I  wouldn’t  like  a  con-con-vertible</p>
      <p>and a guh-guh-girl friend? But did you ever have people l-l-laughing at you? No, because you’re so</p>
      <p>b-big  and  so  tough!  Well,  I’m  not  big  and  tough.  Neither  is  Harding.  Neither  is  F-Fredrickson.</p>
      <p>Neither is SuhSefelt. Oh—oh, you—you t-talk like we stayed in here because we liked it! Oh—it’s n-</p>
      <p>no use …”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>110</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>He’s crying and stuttering too hard to say anything else, and he wipes his eyes with the backs of</p>
      <p>his hands so he can see. One of the scabs pulls off his hand, and the more he wipes the more he</p>
      <p>smears blood over his face and in his eyes. Then he starts running blind, bouncing down the hall</p>
      <p>from side to side with his face a smear of blood, a black boy right after him.</p>
      <p>McMurphy turns round to the rest of the guys and opens his mouth to ask something else, and</p>
      <p>then closes it when he sees how they’re looking at him. He stands there a minute with the row of</p>
      <p>eyes aimed at him like a row of rivets; then he says, “Hell’s bells,” in a weak sort of way, and he puts</p>
      <p>his cap back on and pulls it down hard and goes back to his place on the bench. The two technicians</p>
      <p>come back from coffee and go back in that room across the hall; when the door whooshes open you</p>
      <p>can smell the acid in the air like when they recharge a battery. McMurphy sits there, looking at that</p>
      <p>door.</p>
      <p>“I don’t seem able to get it straight in my mind. ...”</p>
      <empty-line/>

      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>23</p>
      <p>Crossing the grounds back to the ward, McMurphy lagged back at the tail end of the bunch with</p>
      <p>his  hands  in  the pockets of  his  greens  and  his  cap  tugged  low  on  his  head,  brooding  over  a  cold</p>
      <p>cigarette. Everybody was keeping pretty quiet. They’d got Billy calmed down, and he was walking at</p>
      <p>the front of the group with a black boy on one side and that white boy from the Shock Shop on the</p>
      <p>other side.</p>
      <p>I dropped back till I was walking beside McMurphy and I wanted to tell him not to fret about it,</p>
      <p>that nothing could be done, because I could see that there was some thought he was worrying over</p>
      <p>in his mind like a dog worries at a hole he don’t know what’s down, one voice saying, Dog, that hole</p>
      <p>is none of your affair—it’s too big and too black and there’s a spoor all over the place says bears or</p>
      <p>something just as bad. And some other voice coming like a sharp whisper out of way back  in his</p>
      <p>breed, not a smart voice, nothing cagey about it, saying, Sic ‘im, dog, sic ‘im!</p>
      <p>I wanted to tell him not to fret about it, and I was just  about to come out and say it when he</p>
      <p>raised his head and shoved his hat back and speeded up to where the least black boy was walking</p>
      <p>and  slapped  him  on  the  shoulder  and  asked  him,  “Sam,  what  say  we  stop  by  the  canteen  here  a</p>
      <p>second so I can pick me up a carton or two of cigarettes.”</p>
      <p>I had to hurry to catch up, and the run made my heart ring a high, excited pitch in my head. Even</p>
      <p>in the canteen I still heard that sound my heart had knocked ringing in my head, though my heart</p>
      <p>had slowed back to normal. The sound reminded me of how I used to feel standing in the cold fall</p>
      <p>Friday night out on a football field, waiting for the ball to be kicked and the game to get going. The</p>
      <p>ringing would build and build till I didn’t think I could stand still  any longer; then the kick would</p>
      <p>come and it would be gone and the game would be on its way. I felt that same Friday-night ringing</p>
      <p>now, and felt the same wild, stomping-up-and-down impatience. And I was seeing sharp and high-</p>
      <p>pitched too, the way I did before a game and the way I did looking out of the dorm window a while</p>
      <p>back: everything was sharp and clear and solid like I forgot [170] it could be. Lines of toothpaste and</p>
      <p>shoelaces,  ranks  of  sunglasses  and  ballpoint  pens  guaranteed  right  on  them  to  write  a  lifetime  on</p>
      <p>butter under water, all guarded against shoplifters by a big-eyed force of Teddy bears sitting high on</p>
      <p>a shelf over the counter.</p>
      <p>McMurphy came stomping up to the counter beside me and hooked his thumbs in his pockets</p>
      <p>and told the salesgirl to give him a couple of cartons of Marlboros. “Maybe make it three cartons,”</p>
      <p>he said, grinning at her. “I plan to do a lot of smokin’.”</p>
      <p>The ringing didn’t stop until the meeting that afternoon. I’d been half listening to them work on</p>
      <p>Sefelt to get him to face up to the reality of his problems so he could adjust (“It’s the Dilantin!” he</p>
      <p>finally yells. “Now, Mr. Sefelt, if you’re to be helped, you must be honest,” she says. “But, it’s got to</p>
      <p>be the Dilantin that does it; don’t it make my gums soft?” She smiles. “Jim, you’re forty-five years old</p>
      <p>…”) when I happened to catch a look at McMurphy sitting in his corner. He wasn’t fiddling with a</p>
      <p>deck of cards or dozing into a magazine like he had been during all the meetings the last two weeks.</p>
      <p>And he wasn’t slouched down. He was sitting up stiff in his chair with a flushed, reckless look on his</p>
      <p>face  as  he  looked  back  and  forth  from  Sefelt  to  the  Big  Nurse.  As  I  watched,  the  ringing  went</p>
      <p>higher. His eyes were blue stripes under those white eyebrows, and they shot back and forth just the</p>
      <p>way he watched cards turning up around a poker table. I was certain that any minute he was going to</p>
      <p>do  some  crazy  thing  to  get  him  up  on  Disturbed  for  sure.  I’d  seen  the  same  look  on  other  guys</p>
      <p>before  they’d  climbed  all  over  a  black  boy.  I  gripped  down  on  the  arm  of  my  chair  and  waited,</p>
      <p>scared it would happen, and, I began to realize, just a little scared it wouldn’t.</p>
      <p>He kept quiet and watched till they were finished with Sefelt; then he swung half around in his</p>
      <p>chair  and  watched  while  Fredrickson,  trying  some  way  to  get  back  at  them  for  the  way  they  had</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>112</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>grilled  his  friend,  griped  for  a  few  loud  minutes  about  the  cigarettes  being  kept  in  the  Nurses’</p>
      <p>Station. Fredrickson talked himself out and finally flushed and apologized like always and sat back</p>
      <p>down. McMurphy still hadn’t made any kind of move. I eased up where I’d been gripping the arm of</p>
      <p>the chair, beginning to think I’d been wrong.</p>
      <p>There was just a couple of minutes left in the meeting. The Big Nurse folded up her papers and</p>
      <p>put  them  in  the  basket  and  set  the  basket  off  her  lap  on  the  floor,  then  let  her  eyes  swing  to</p>
      <p>McMurphy for just a second like she wanted to check if he was awake and listening. She folded her</p>
      <p>hands in her lap and [171] looked down at the fingers and drew a deep breath, shaking her head.</p>
      <p>“Boys, I’ve given a great deal of thought to what I am about to say. I’ve talked it over with the</p>
      <p>doctor  and  with  the  rest  of  the  staff,  and,  as  much  as  we  regretted  it,  we  all  came  to  the  same</p>
      <p>conclusion—that  there  should  be  some  manner  of  punishment  meted  out  for  the  unspeakable</p>
      <p>behavior  concerning  the  house  duties  three  weeks  ago.”  She  raised  her  hand  and  looked  around.</p>
      <p>“We  waited  this  long  to  say  anything,  hoping  that  you  men  would  take  it  upon  yourselves  to</p>
      <p>apologize  for  the  rebellious  way  you  acted.  But  not  a  one  of  you  has  shown  the  slightest  sign  of</p>
      <p>remorse.”</p>
      <p>Her hand went up again to stop any interruptions that might come—the movement of a tarot-</p>
      <p>card reader in a glass arcade case.</p>
      <p>“Please understand: We do not impose certain rules and restrictions on you without a great deal</p>
      <p>of  thought  about their  therapeutic  value.  A  good  many  of  you  are  in  here  because  you  could  not</p>
      <p>adjust to the rules of society in the Outside World, because you refused to face up to them, because</p>
      <p>you tried to circumvent them and avoid them. At some time—perhaps in your childhood—you may</p>
      <p>have been allowed to get away with flouting the rules of society. When you broke a rule you knew it.</p>
      <p>You wanted to be dealt with, needed it, but the punishment did not come. That foolish lenience on</p>
      <p>the part of your parents may have been the germ that grew into your present illness. I tell you this</p>
      <p>hoping you will understand that it is entirely for your own good that we enforce discipline and order.”</p>
      <p>She let her head twist around the room. Regret for the job she has to do was worked into her</p>
      <p>face. It was quiet except for that high fevered, delirious ringing in my head.</p>
      <p>“It’s difficult to enforce discipline in these surroundings. You must be able to see that. What can</p>
      <p>we do to you? You can’t be arrested. You can’t be put on bread and water. You must see that the</p>
      <p>staff has a problem; what can we do?”</p>
      <p>Ruckly had an idea  what they could do, but she didn’t pay any attention to it. The face moved</p>
      <p>with a ticking noise till the features achieved a different look. She finally answered her own question.</p>
      <p>“We  must  take  away  a  privilege.  And  after  careful  consideration  of  the  circumstances  of  this</p>
      <p>rebellion, we’ve decided that there would be a certain justice in taking away the privilege of the tub</p>
      <p>room that you men have been using for your card games during the day. Does this seem unfair?”</p>
      <p>Her head didn’t move. She didn’t look. But one by one [172] everybody else looked at him sitting</p>
      <p>there  in  his  corner.  Even  the  old  Chronics,  wondering  why  everybody had  turned  to  look  in  one</p>
      <p>direction,  stretched  out  their  scrawny  necks  like  birds  and  turned  to  look  at  McMurphy—faces</p>
      <p>turned to him, full of a naked, scared hope.</p>
      <p>That single thin note in my head was like tires speeding down a pavement.</p>
      <p>He was sitting straight up in his chair, one big red finger scratching lazily at the stitchmarks run</p>
      <p>across his nose. He grinned at everybody looking at him and took his cap by the brim and tipped it</p>
      <p>politely, then looked back at the nurse.</p>
      <p>“So, if there is no discussion on this ruling, I think the hour is almost over …”</p>
      <p>She  paused  again,  took  a  look  at  him  herself.  He  shrugged  his  shoulders  and  with  a  loud  sigh</p>
      <p>slapped both hands down on his knees and pushed himself standing out of the chair. He stretched</p>
      <p>and yawned and scratched the nose again and started strolling across the day-room floor to where</p>
      <p>she sat by the Nurses’ Station, heisting his pants with his thumbs as he walked. I could see it was too</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>113</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>late to keep him from doing whatever fool thing he had in mind, and I just watched, like everybody</p>
      <p>else. He walked with long steps, too long, and he had his thumbs hooked in his pockets again. The</p>
      <p>iron  in  his  boot  heels  cracked  lightning  out  of  the  tile.  He  was  the  logger  again,  the  swaggering</p>
      <p>gambler,  the  big  redheaded  brawling  Irishman,  the  cowboy  out  of  the  TV  set  walking  down  the</p>
      <p>middle of the street to meet a dare.</p>
      <p>The  Big  Nurse’s  eyes  swelled  out  white  as  he  got  close.  She  hadn’t  reckoned  on  him  doing</p>
      <p>anything. This was supposed to be her final victory over him, supposed to establish her rule once</p>
      <p>and for all. But here he comes and he’s big as a house!</p>
      <p>She started popping her mouth and looking for her black boys, scared to death, but be stopped</p>
      <p>before he got to her. He stopped in front of her window and he said in his slowest, deepest drawl</p>
      <p>how he figured he could use one of the smokes he bought this mornin’, then ran his hand through</p>
      <p>the glass.</p>
      <p>The glass came apart like water splashing, and the nurse threw her hands to her ears. He got one</p>
      <p>of the cartons of cigarettes with his name on it and took out a pack, then put it back and turned to</p>
      <p>where the Big Nurse was sitting like a chalk statue and very tenderly went to brushing the slivers of</p>
      <p>glass off her hat and shoulders.</p>
      <p>“I’m  sure sorry,  ma’am,” he  said.  “Gawd  but  I  am. That  window  glass  was  so  spick  and  span  I</p>
      <p>com-pletely forgot it was there.”</p>
      <p>[173] It took just a couple of seconds. He turned and left her sitting there with her face shifting</p>
      <p>and jerking and walked back across the day room to his chair, lighting up a cigarette.</p>
      <p>The ringing that was in my head had stopped.</p>

      </p><p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>

      <p>After that, McMurphy had things his way for a good long while. The nurse was biding her time</p>
      <p>till another idea came to her that would put her on top again. She knew she’d lost one big round and</p>
      <p>was  losing  another,  but  she  wasn’t  in  any  hurry.  For  one  thing,  she  wasn’t  about  to  recommend</p>
      <p>release; the fight could go on as long as she wanted, till he made a mistake or till he just gave out, or</p>
      <p>until she could come up with some new tactic that would put her back on top in everybody’s eyes.</p>
      <p>A good lot happened before she came up with that new tactic. After McMurphy was drawn out</p>
      <p>of what you might call a short retirement and had announced he was back in the hassle by breaking</p>
      <p>out  her  personal  window,  he  made  things  on  the  ward  pretty  interesting.  He  took  part  in  every</p>
      <p>meeting, every discussion—drawling, winking, joking his best to wheedle a skinny laugh out of some</p>
      <p>Acute who’d been scared to grin since he was twelve. He got together enough guys for a basketball</p>
      <p>team and some way talked the doctor into letting him bring a ball back from the gym to get the team</p>
      <p>used to handling it. [175] The nurse objected, said the next thing they’d be playing soccer in the day</p>
      <p>room and polo games up and down the hall, but the doctor held firm for once and said let them go.</p>
      <p>“A  number of  the  players, Miss  Ratched,  have  shown  marked  progress  since  that  basketball  team</p>
      <p>was organized; I think it has proven its therapeutic value.”</p>
      <p>She looked at him a while in amazement. So he was doing a little muscle-flexing too. She marked</p>
      <p>the tone of his voice for later, for when her time came again, and just nodded and went to sit in her</p>
      <p>Nurses’ Station and fiddle with the controls on her equipment. The janitors had put a cardboard in</p>
      <p>the frame over her desk till they could get another window pane cut to fit, and she sat there behind</p>
      <p>it every day like it wasn’t even there, just like she could still see right into the day room. Behind that</p>
      <p>square of cardboard she was like a picture turned to the wall.</p>
      <p>She  waited,  without  comment,  while  McMurphy  continued  to  run  around  the  halls  in  the</p>
      <p>mornings in his white-whale shorts, or pitched pennies in the dorms, or ran up and down the hall</p>
      <p>blowing a nickel-plated ref’s whistle, teaching Acutes the fast break from ward door to the Seclusion</p>
      <p>Room at the other end, the ball pounding in the corridor like cannon shots and McMurphy roaring</p>
      <p>like a sergeant, “Drive, you puny mothers, drive!”</p>
      <p>When either one spoke to the other it was always in the most polite fashion. He would ask her</p>
      <p>nice as you please if he could use her fountain pen to write a request for an Unaccompanied Leave</p>
      <p>from the hospital, wrote it out in front of her on her desk, and handed her the request and the pen</p>
      <p>back at the same time with such a nice, “Thank you,” and she would look at it and say just as polite</p>
      <p>that she would “take it up with the staff”—which took maybe three minutes—and come back to tell</p>
      <p>him she certainly was sorry but a pass was not considered therapeutic at this time. He would thank</p>
      <p>her again and walk out of the Nurses’ Station and blow that whistle loud enough to break windows</p>
      <p>for miles, and holler, “Practice, you mothers, get that ball and let’s get a little sweat rollin’.”</p>
      <p>He’d been on the ward a month, long enough to sign the bulletin board in the hall to request a</p>
      <p>hearing in group meeting about an Accompanied Pass. He went to the bulletin board with her pen</p>
      <p>and  put  down  under  TO  BE  ACCOMPANIED  BY:  “A  twitch  I  know  from  Portland  named  Candy</p>
      <p>Starr.”—and ruined the pen point on the period. The pass request was brought up in group meeting</p>
      <p>a  few  days  later,  the  same  day,  in  fact, that  workmen  put  a  new  glass  window  in  front  of the  Big</p>
      <p>Nurse’s [176] desk, and after his request had been turned down on the grounds that this Miss Starr</p>
      <p>didn’t  seem  like  the  most  wholesome  person  for  a  patient  to  go  pass  with,  he  shrugged  and  said</p>
      <p>that’s how she bounces I guess, and got up and walked to the Nurses’ Station, to the window that</p>
      <p>still had the sticker from the glass company down in the corner, and ran his fist through it again—</p>
      <p>explained to the nurse while blood poured from his fingers that he thought the cardboard had been</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>116</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>left out and the frame was open. “When did they sneak that danged glass in there? Why that thing is</p>
      <p>a menace!”</p>
      <p>The nurse taped his hand in the station while Scanlon and Harding dug the cardboard out of the</p>
      <p>garbage and taped it back in the frame, using adhesive from the same roll the nurse was bandaging</p>
      <p>McMurphy’s wrist and fingers with. McMurphy sat on a stool, grimacing something awful while he</p>
      <p>got his cuts tended, winking at Scanlon and Harding over the nurse’s head. The expression on her</p>
      <p>face was calm and blank as enamel, but the strain was beginning to show in other ways. By the way</p>
      <p>she jerked the adhesive tight as she could, showing her remote patience wasn’t what it used to be.</p>
      <p>We  got  to  go  to  the  gym  and  watch  our  basketball  team—Harding,  Billy  Bibbit,  Scanlon,</p>
      <p>Fredrickson, Martini, and McMurphy whenever his hand would stop bleeding long enough for him</p>
      <p>to get in the game—play a team of aides. Our two big black boys played for the aides. They were the</p>
      <p>best  players  on  the  court,  running  up  and  down  the  floor  together  like  a  pair  of  shadows  in  red</p>
      <p>trunks, scoring basket after basket with mechanical accuracy. Our team was too short and too slow,</p>
      <p>and Martini kept throwing passes to men that nobody but him could see, and the aides beat us by</p>
      <p>twenty points. But something happened that let most of us come away feeling there’d been a kind of</p>
      <p>victory, anyhow: in one scramble for the ball our big black boy named Washington got cracked with</p>
      <p>somebody’s elbow, and his team had to hold him back as he stood straining to where McMurphy</p>
      <p>was sitting on the ball—not paying the least bit of heed to the thrashing black boy with red pouring</p>
      <p>out of his big nose and down his chest like paint splashed on a blackboard and hollering to the guys</p>
      <p>holding him, “He beggin’ for it! The sonabitch jus’ beggin’ for it!”</p>
      <p>McMurphy composed more notes for the nurse to find in the latrine with her mirror. He wrote</p>
      <p>long outlandish tales about himself in the log book and signed them Anon. Sometimes he slept till</p>
      <p>eight o’clock. She would reprimand him, without heat at all, and he would stand and listen till she</p>
      <p>was finished and then destroy her whole effect by asking something [177] like did she wear a B cup,</p>
      <p>he wondered, or a C cup, or any ol’ cup at all?</p>
      <p>The other Acutes were beginning to follow his lead. Harding began flirting with all the student</p>
      <p>nurses,  and  Billy  Bibbit  completely  quit  writing  what  he  used to  call  his  “observations”  in the  log</p>
      <p>book,  and  when  the  window  in  front  of  her  desk  got  replaced  again,  with  a  big  X  across  it  in</p>
      <p>whitewash to make sure McMurphy didn’t have any excuse for not knowing it was there, Scanlon</p>
      <p>did it in by accidentally bouncing our basketball through it before the whitewashed X was even dry.</p>
      <p>The ball punctured, and Martini picked it off the floor like a dead bird and carried it to the nurse in</p>
      <p>the  station,  where  she  was  staring  at  the  new  splash  of  broken  glass  all  over  her  desk,  and  asked</p>
      <p>couldn’t she please fix it with tape or something? Make it well again? Without a word she jerked it</p>
      <p>out of his hand and stuffed it in the garbage.</p>
      <p>So,  with  basketball  season  obviously  over,  McMurphy  decided  fishing  was  the  thing.  He</p>
      <p>requested another pass after telling the doctor he had some friends at the Siuslaw Bay at Florence</p>
      <p>who would like to take eight or nine of the patients out deep-sea fishing if it was okay with the staff,</p>
      <p>and  he  wrote  on  the  request  list  out  in  the  hall  that  this  time  he  would  be  accompanied  by  “two</p>
      <p>sweet old aunts from a little place outside of Oregon City.” In the meeting his pass was granted for</p>
      <p>the next weekend. When the nurse finished officially noting his pass in her roll book, she reached</p>
      <p>into her wicker bag beside her feet and drew out a clipping that she had taken from the paper that</p>
      <p>morning, and read out loud that although fishing off the coast of Oregon was having a peak year,</p>
      <p>the  salmon  were running  quite  late  in  the  season  and  the  sea  was  rough  and  dangerous.  And  she</p>
      <p>would suggest the men give that some thought.</p>
      <p>“Good  idea,”  McMurphy  said.  He  closed his  eyes and  sucked  a  deep breath  through  his  teeth.</p>
      <p>“Yes  sir!  The  salt  smell  o’  the  poundin’  sea,  the  crack  o’  the bow  against  the  waves—braving  the</p>
      <p>elements, where men are men and boats are boats. Miss Ratched, you’ve talked me into it. I’ll call</p>
      <p>and rent that boat this very night. Shall I sign you on?”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>117</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>Instead of answering she walked to the bulletin board and pinned up the clipping.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>The next day he started signing up the guys that wanted to go and that had ten bucks to chip in</p>
      <p>on  boat  rent,  and  the  nurse  started  steadily  bringing  in  clippings  from  the  newspapers  that  told</p>
      <p>about wrecked boats and sudden storms on the coast. [178] McMurphy pooh-poohed her and her</p>
      <p>clippings, saying that his two aunts had spent most of their lives bouncing around the waves in one</p>
      <p>port  or  another  with  this  sailor  or  that,  and  they both  guaranteed  the trip  was  safe  as  pie,  safe  as</p>
      <p>pudding, not a thing to worry about. But the nurse still knew her patients. The clippings scared them</p>
      <p>more than McMurphy’d figured. He’d figured there would be a rush to sign up, but he’d had to talk</p>
      <p>and wheedle to get the guys he did. The day before the trip he still needed a couple more before he</p>
      <p>could pay for the boat.</p>
      <p>I  didn’t  have  the  money,  but  I  kept  getting  this  notion that  I  wanted  to  sign  the  list.  And  the</p>
      <p>more he  talked  about  fishing  for  Chinook  salmon the more  I  wanted to  go. I  knew  it  was  a  fool</p>
      <p>thing to want; if I signed up it’d be the same as coming right out and telling everybody I wasn’t deaf.</p>
      <p>If  I’d been  hearing  all  this  talk  about boats  and  fishing  it’d  show I’d been  hearing  everything  else</p>
      <p>that’d been  said  in  confidence  around  me  for the past  ten  years.  And  if  the  Big  Nurse  found out</p>
      <p>about  that,  that  I’d  heard  all  the  scheming  and  treachery  that  had  gone  on  when  she  didn’t think</p>
      <p>anybody was listening, she’d hunt me down with an electric saw, fix me where she knew I was deaf</p>
      <p>and dumb. Bad as I wanted to go, it still made me smile a little to think about it: I had to keep on</p>
      <p>acting deaf if I wanted to hear at all.</p>
      <p>I lay in bed the night before the fishing trip and thought it over, about my being deaf, about the</p>
      <p>years of not letting on I heard what was said, and I wondered if I could ever act any other way again.</p>
      <p>But  I  remembered  one  thing:  it  wasn’t  me  that  started  acting  deaf;  it  was  people  that  first  started</p>
      <p>acting like I was too dumb to hear or see or say anything at all.</p>
      <p>It hadn’t been just since I came in the hospital, either; people first took to acting like I couldn’t</p>
      <p>hear or talk a long time before that. In the Army anybody with more stripes acted that way toward</p>
      <p>me. That was the way they figured you were supposed to act around someone looked like I did. And</p>
      <p>even as far back as grade school I can remember people saying that they didn’t think I was listening,</p>
      <p>so they quit listening to the things I was saying. Lying there in bed, I tried to think back when I first</p>
      <p>noticed  it.  I  think  it  was  once  when  we  were  still  living  in  the  village  on  the  Columbia.  It  was</p>
      <p>summer. ...</p>
      <p>… and I’m about ten years old and I’m out in front of the shack sprinkling salt on salmon for the</p>
      <p>racks behind the house, when I see a car turn off the highway and come lumbering across the ruts</p>
      <p>through the sage, towing a load of red dust behind it as solid as a string of boxcars.</p>
      <p>[179] I watch the car pull up the hill and stop down a piece from our yard, and the dust keeps</p>
      <p>coming, crashing into the rear of it and busting in every direction and finally settling on the sage and</p>
      <p>soapweed round about and making it look like chunks of red, smoking wreckage. The car sits there</p>
      <p>while  the  dust  settles,  shimmering  in  the  sun.  I  know  it  isn’t  tourists  with  cameras  because  they</p>
      <p>never drive this close to the village. If they want to buy fish they buy them back at the highway; they</p>
      <p>don’t come to the village because they probably think we still scalp people and burn them around a</p>
      <p>post. They don’t know some of our people are lawyers in Portland, probably wouldn’t believe it if I</p>
      <p>told them. In fact, one of my uncles became a real lawyer and Papa says he did it purely to prove he</p>
      <p>could, when he’d rather poke salmon in the fall than anything. Papa says if you don’t watch it people</p>
      <p>will force you one way or the other, into doing what they think you should do, or into just being</p>
      <p>mule-stubborn and doing the opposite out of spite.</p>
      <p>The doors of the car open all at once and three people get out, two out of the front and one out</p>
      <p>of the back. They come climbing up the slope toward our village and I see the first two are men in</p>
      <p>blue suits, and the behind one, the one that got out of the back, is an old white-haired woman in an</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>118</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>outfit so stiff and heavy it must be armor plate. They’re puffing and sweating by the time they break</p>
      <p>out of the sage into our bald yard.</p>
      <p>The first man stops and looks the village over. He’s short and round and wearing a white Stetson</p>
      <p>hat. He shakes his head at the rickety clutter of fishracks and secondhand cars and chicken coops</p>
      <p>and motorcycles and dogs.</p>
      <p>“Have you ever in all your born days seen the like? Have you now? I swear to heaven, have you</p>
      <p>ever?”</p>
      <p>He pulls off the hat and pats his red rubber ball of a head with a handkerchief, careful, like he’s</p>
      <p>afraid of getting one or the other mussed up—the handkerchief or the dab of damp stringy hair.</p>
      <p>“Can  you  imagine  people  wanting  to  live  this  way?  Tell  me,  John, can  you?”  He  talks  loud  on</p>
      <p>account of not being used to the roar of the falls.</p>
      <p>John’s next to him, got a thick gray mustache lifted tight up under his nose to stop out the smell</p>
      <p>of the salmon I’m working on. He’s sweated down his neck and cheeks, and he’s sweated clean out</p>
      <p>through  the back  of  his  blue  suit.  He’s  making  notes  in  a  book,  and  he  keeps  turning  in  a  circle,</p>
      <p>looking at our shack, our little garden, at Mama’s red and green and yellow Saturday-night dresses</p>
      <p>drying out back on a stretch [180] of bedcord—keeps turning till he makes a full circle and comes</p>
      <p>back to me, looks at me like he just sees me for the first time, and me not but two yards away from</p>
      <p>him.  He  bends  toward  me  and  squints  and  lifts  his  mustache  up  to  his  nose  again  like  it’s  me</p>
      <p>stinking instead of the fish.</p>
      <p>“Where do you suppose his parents are?” John asks. “Inside the house? Or out on the falls? We</p>
      <p>might as well talk this over with the man while we’re out here.”</p>
      <p>“I, for one, am not going inside that hovel,” the fat guy says.</p>
      <p>“That hovel,” John says through his mustache, “is where the Chief lives, Brickenridge, the man</p>
      <p>we are here to deal with, the noble leader of these people.”</p>
      <p>“Deal with? Not me, not my job. They pay me to appraise, not fraternize.”</p>
      <p>This gets a laugh out of John.</p>
      <p>“Yes, that’s true. But someone should inform them of the government’s plans.”</p>
      <p>“If they don’t already know, they’ll know soon enough.”</p>
      <p>“It would be very simple to go in and talk with him.”</p>
      <p>“Inside  in  that  squalor?  Why,  I’ll  just  bet  you  anything  that place  is  acrawl  with  black  widows.</p>
      <p>They say these ‘dobe shacks always house a regular civilization in the walls between the sods. And</p>
      <p>hot, lord-a-mercy, I hope to tell you. I’ll wager it’s a regular oven in there. Look, look how overdone</p>
      <p>little Hiawatha is here. Ho. Burnt to a fair turn, he is.”</p>
      <p>He laughs and dabs at his head and when the woman looks at him he stops laughing. He clears</p>
      <p>his throat and spits into the dust and then walks over and sits down in the swing Papa built for me</p>
      <p>in the juniper tree, and sits there swinging back and forth a little bit and fanning himself  with his</p>
      <p>Stetson.</p>
      <p>What he said makes me madder the more I think about it. He and John go ahead talking about</p>
      <p>our  house  and  village  and  property  and  what  they  are  worth,  and  I  get  the  notion  they’re  talking</p>
      <p>about these things around me because they don’t know I speak English. They are probably from the</p>
      <p>East someplace, where people don’t know anything about Indians but what they see in the movies. I</p>
      <p>think how ashamed they’re going to be when they find out I know what they are saying.</p>
      <p>I let them say another thing or two about the heat and the house; then I stand up and tell the fat</p>
      <p>man, in my very best schoolbook language, that our sod house is likely to be cooler than any one of</p>
      <p>the  houses  in  town,  lots  cooler!  “I  know  for  a  fact  that  it’s  cooler’n  that  school  I  go  to  and  even</p>
      <p>cooler’n that movie house in The Dalles that advertises on that sign drawn with icicle letters that it’s</p>
      <p>‘cool inside’!”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>119</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>[181] And I’m just about to go and tell them, how, if they’ll come on in, I’ll go get Papa from the</p>
      <p>scaffolds  on the  falls,  when  I  see that  they  don’t  look  like  they’d heard me  talk  at  all.  They  aren’t</p>
      <p>even looking at me. The fat man is swinging back and forth, looking off down the ridge of lava to</p>
      <p>where the men are standing their places on the scaffolding in the falls, just plaidshirted shapes in the</p>
      <p>mist  from  this  distance.  Every  so  often  you  can  see  somebody  shoot  out  an  arm  and  take  a  step</p>
      <p>forward  like  a  swordfighter,  and  then  hold  up  his  fifteen-foot  forked  spear  for  somebody  on  the</p>
      <p>scaffold above him to pull off the flopping salmon. The fat guy watches the men standing in their</p>
      <p>places in the fifty-foot veil of water, and bats his eyes and grunts every time one of them makes a</p>
      <p>lunge for a salmon.</p>
      <p>The other two, John and the woman, are just standing. Not a one of the three acts like they heard</p>
      <p>a thing I said; in fact they’re all looking off from me like they’d as soon I wasn’t there at all.</p>
      <p>And everything stops and hangs this way for a minute.</p>
      <p>I  get  the  funniest  feeling  that  the  sun  is  turned  up  brighter  than  before  on  the three  of  them.</p>
      <p>Everything else  looks  like  it  usually  does—the  chickens  fussing  around  in  the  grass  on  top  of  the</p>
      <p>‘dobe houses, the grasshoppers batting from bush to bush, the flies being stirred into black clouds</p>
      <p>around the fish racks by the little kids with sage flails, just like every other summer day. Except the</p>
      <p>sun, on these three strangers, is all of a sudden way the hell brighter than usual and I can see the ...</p>
      <p>seams where they’re put together. And, almost, see the apparatus inside them take the words I just</p>
      <p>said  and try to fit the words in here and there, this place and that, and when they find the words</p>
      <p>don’t  have  any  place  ready-made  where  they’ll  fit,  the  machinery  disposes  of  the  words  like  they</p>
      <p>weren’t even spoken.</p>
      <p>The three are stock still while this goes on. Even the swing’s stopped, nailed out at a slant by the</p>
      <p>sun,  with  the  fat  man  petrified  in  it  like  a  rubber  doll.  Then  Papa’s  guinea  hen  wakes  up  in  the</p>
      <p>juniper branches and sees we got strangers on the premises and goes to barking at them like a dog,</p>
      <p>and the spell breaks.</p>
      <p>The fat man hollers and jumps out of the swing and sidles away through the dust, holding his hat</p>
      <p>up in front of the sun so’s he can see what’s up there in the juniper tree making such a racket. When</p>
      <p>he sees it’s nothing but a speckled chicken he spits on the ground and puts his hat on.</p>
      <p>[182] “I, myself, sincerely feel,” he says, “that whatever offer we make on this ... metropolis will be</p>
      <p>quite sufficient.”</p>
      <p>“Could be. I still think we should make some effort to speak with the Chief—”</p>
      <p>The old woman interrupts him by taking one ringing step forward. “No.” This is the first thing</p>
      <p>she’s said. “No,” she says again in a way that reminds me of the Big Nurse. She lifts her eyebrows</p>
      <p>and  looks  the  place  over.  Her  eyes  spring  up  like  the  numbers  in  a  cash  register;  she’s  looking  at</p>
      <p>Mamma’s dresses hung so careful on the line, and she’s nodding her head.</p>
      <p>“No.  We  don’t  talk  with  the  Chief  today. Not  yet.  I  think  .  that  I  agree  with  Brickenridge  for</p>
      <p>once. Only for a different reason. You recall the record we have shows the wife is not Indian but</p>
      <p>white? White. A woman from town. Her name is Bromden. He took her name, not she his. Oh, yes,</p>
      <p>I  think  if  we  just  leave  now  and  go  back  into  town,  and,  of  course,  spread  the  word  with  the</p>
      <p>townspeople  about  the  government’s  plans  so  they  understand  the  advantages  of  having  a</p>
      <p>hydroelectric dam and a lake instead of a cluster of shacks beside a falls, then type up an offer—and</p>
      <p>mail it to the wife, you see, by mistake? I feel our job will be a great deal easier.”</p>
      <p>She  looks  off to the  men  on the  ancient,  rickety,  zigzagging  scaffolding  that  has  been  growing</p>
      <p>and branching out among the rocks of the falls for hundreds of years.</p>
      <p>“Whereas if we meet now with the husband and make some abrupt offer, we may run up against</p>
      <p>an untold amount of Navaho stubbornness and love of—I suppose we must call it home.”</p>
      <p>I start to tell them he’s not Navaho, but think what’s the use if they don’t listen? They don’t care</p>
      <p>what tribe he is.</p>

      <p>120</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>The woman smiles and nods at both the men, a smile and a nod to each, and her eyes ring them</p>
      <p>up, and she begins to move stiffly back to their car, talking in a light, young voice.</p>
      <p>“As my sociology professor used to emphasize, ‘There is generally one person in every situation</p>
      <p>you must never underestimate the power of.’ ”</p>
      <p>And they get back in the car and drive away, with me standing there wondering if they ever even</p>
      <p>saw me.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>I  was  kind  of  amazed  that  I’d  remembered  that.  It  was  the  first  time  in  what  seemed  to  me</p>
      <p>centuries that I’d been able to remember much about my childhood. It fascinated me to discover I</p>
      <p>could still do it. I lay in bed awake, remembering other happenings, and just about that time, while I</p>
      <p>was half in a kind of dream, I heard a sound under my bed like a mouse [183] with a walnut. I leaned</p>
      <p>over the edge of the bed and saw the shine of metal biting off pieces of gum I knew by heart. The</p>
      <p>black boy named Geever had found where I’d been hiding my chewing gum; was scraping the pieces</p>
      <p>off into a sack with a long, lean pair of scissors open like jaws.</p>
      <p>I jerked back up under the covers before he saw me looking. My heart was banging in my ears,</p>
      <p>scared  he’d  seen  me.  I  wanted  to  tell  him  to  get  away,  to  mind  his  own  business  and  leave  my</p>
      <p>chewing gum alone, but I couldn’t even let on I heard. I lay still to see if he’d caught me bending</p>
      <p>over to peek under the bed at him, but he didn’t give any sign—all I heard was the zzzth-zzzth of</p>
      <p>his scissors and pieces falling into the sack, reminded me of hailstones the way they used to rattle on</p>
      <p>our tar-paper roof. He clacked his tongue and giggled to himself.</p>
      <p>“Um-ummm. Lord Bawd amighty. Hee. I wonder how many times this muthuh chewed some o’</p>
      <p>this stuff? Just as hard.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy heard  the black  boy muttering  to  himself  and  woke  and  rolled  up  to one  elbow  to</p>
      <p>look at what he was up to at this hour down on his knees under my bed. He watched the black boy a</p>
      <p>minute, rubbing his eyes to be sure of what he was seeing, just like you see little kids rub their eyes;</p>
      <p>then he sat up completely.</p>
      <p>“I will be a sonofabitch if he ain’t in here at eleven-thirty at night, fartin’ around in the dark with</p>
      <p>a  pair  of  scissors  and  a  paper  sack.”  The  black  boy  jumped  and  swung  his  flashlight  up  in</p>
      <p>McMurphy’s  eyes.  “Now  tell  me,  Sam:  what  the  devil  are  you  collectin’  that  needs  the  cover  of</p>
      <p>night?”</p>
      <p>“Go back to sleep, McMurphy. It don’t concern nobody else.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy let his lips spread in a slow grin, but he didn’t look away from the light. The black</p>
      <p>boy got uneasy after about half a minute of shining that light on McMurphy sitting there, on that</p>
      <p>glossy new-healed scar and those teeth and that tattooed panther on his shoulder, and took the light</p>
      <p>away.  He  bent  back  to  his  work,  grunting  and  puffing  like  it  was  a  mighty  effort prying  off  dried</p>
      <p>gum.</p>
      <p>“One of the duties of a night aide,” he explained between grunts, trying to sound friendly, “is to</p>
      <p>keep the bedside area cleaned up.”</p>
      <p>“In the dead of night?”</p>
      <p>“McMurphy, we got a thing posted called a Job Description, say cleanliness is a twenty-fo’-hour job!”</p>
      <p>“You might of done your twenty-four hours’ worth before we got in bed, don’t you think, instead</p>
      <p>of sittin’ out there [184] watching TV till ten-thirty. Does Old Lady Ratched know you boys watch</p>
      <p>TV most of your shift? What do you reckon she’d do if she found out about that?”</p>
      <p>The black boy got up and sat on the edge of my bed. He tapped the flashlight against his teeth,</p>
      <p>grinning and giggling. The light lit his face up like a black jack o’lantern.</p>
      <p>“Well, let me tell you about this gum,” he said and leaned close to McMurphy like an old chum.</p>
      <p>“You see, for years I been wondering where Chief Bromden got his chewin’ gum—never havin’ any</p>
      <p>money  for  the  canteen,  never  havin’  anybody  give  him  a  stick  that  I  saw,  never  askin’  Public</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>121</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>Relations—so I watched, and I waited. And look here.” He got back on his knees and lifted the edge of</p>
      <p>my bedspread and shined the light under. “How ‘bout that? I bet they’s pieces of gum under here</p>
      <p>been used a thousand times!”</p>
      <p>This tickled McMurphy. He went to giggling at what he saw. The black boy held up the sack and</p>
      <p>rattled  it,  and  they  laughed  some  more  about  it.  The  black  boy  told  McMurphy  good  night  and</p>
      <p>rolled the top of the sack like it was his lunch and went off somewhere to hide it for later.</p>
      <p>“Chief?” McMurphy whispered. “I want you to tell me something.” And he started to sing a little</p>
      <p>song,  a  hillbilly  song,  popular  a  long  time  ago:  “  ‘Oh,  does  the  Spearmint  lose  its  flavor  on  the</p>
      <p>bedpost overnight?’ “</p>
      <p>At first I started getting real mad. I thought he was making fun of me like other people had.</p>
      <p>“ ‘When you chew it in the morning,’ ” he sang in a whisper, “ ‘will it be too hard to bite?’ ”</p>
      <p>But the more I thought about it the funnier it seemed to me. I tried to stop it but I could feel I</p>
      <p>was about to laugh—not at McMurphy’s singing, but at my own self.</p>
      <p>“ ‘This question’s got me goin’, won’t somebody set me right; does the Spearmint lose its flavor</p>
      <p>on the bedpost o-ver niiiite?’ ”</p>
      <p>He  held  out  that  last  note  and twiddled  it  down  me  like  a  feather.  I  couldn’t  help  but  start to</p>
      <p>chuckle,  and  this  made  me  scared  I’d  get  to  laughing  and  not  be  able  to  stop.  But  just  then</p>
      <p>McMurphy jumped off his bed and went to rustling through his nightstand, and I hushed. I clenched</p>
      <p>my  teeth,  wondering  what  to  do  now.  It’d  been  a  long  time  since  I’d  let  anyone  hear  me  do  any</p>
      <p>more than grunt or bellow. I heard him shut the bedstand, and it echoed like a boiler door. I heard</p>
      <p>him say, “Here,” and something lit on my bed. Little. Just the size of a lizard or a snake ...</p>
      <p>“Juicy Fruit is the best I can do for you at the moment, [185] Chief. Package I won off Scanlon</p>
      <p>pitchin’ pennies.” And he got back in bed.</p>
      <p>And before I realized what I was doing, I told him Thank you.</p>
      <p>He didn’t say anything right off. He was up on his elbow, watching me the way he’d watched the</p>
      <p>black boy, waiting for me to say something else. I picked up the package of gum from the bedspread</p>
      <p>and held it in my hand and told him Thank you.</p>
      <p>It  didn’t  sound  like  much  because  my  throat  was  rusty  and  my  tongue  creaked.  He  told  me  I</p>
      <p>sounded a little out of practice and laughed at that. I tried to laugh with him, but it was a squawking</p>
      <p>sound, like a pullet trying to crow. It sounded more like crying than laughing.</p>
      <p>He told me not to hurry, that he had till six-thirty in the morning to listen if I wanted to practice.</p>
      <p>He said a man been still long as me probably had a considerable lot to talk about, and he lay back on</p>
      <p>his pillow and waited. I thought for a minute for something to say to him, but the only thing that</p>
      <p>came to my mind was the kind of thing one man can’t say to another because it sounds wrong in</p>
      <p>words.  When  he  saw  I  couldn’t  say  anything  he  crossed  his  hands  behind  his  head  and  started</p>
      <p>talking himself.</p>
      <p>“Ya  know,  Chief,  I  was  just  rememberin’  a  time  down  in the  Willamette  Valley—I  was  pickin’</p>
      <p>beans  outside  of  Eugene  and  considering  myself  damn  lucky  to  get  the  job.  It  was  in  the  early</p>
      <p>thirties so there wasn’t many kids able to get jobs. I got the job by proving to the bean boss I could</p>
      <p>pick just as fast and clean as any of the adults. Anyway, I was the only kid in the rows. Nobody else</p>
      <p>around me but grown-ups. And after I tried a time or two to talk to them I saw they weren’t for</p>
      <p>listening to me—scrawny little patchquilt redhead anyhow. So I hushed. I was so peeved at them not</p>
      <p>listening to me I kept hushed the livelong four weeks I picked that field, workin’ right along side of</p>
      <p>them, listening to them prattle on about this uncle or that cousin. Or if somebody didn’t show up</p>
      <p>for work, gossip about him. Four weeks and not a peep out of me. Till I think by God they forgot I</p>
      <p>could  talk,  the  mossbacked  old  bastards.  I  bided  my  time.  Then,  on  the  last  day,  I  opened  up  and</p>
      <p>went to telling them what a petty bunch of farts they were. I told each one just how his buddy had</p>
      <p>drug him over the coals when he was absent. Hooee, did they listen then! They finally got to arguing</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>122</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>with each other and created such a shitstorm I lost my quarter-cent-a-pound bonus I had comin’ for</p>
      <p>not missin’ a day because I already had a bad reputation around town and the bean boss claimed the</p>
      <p>disturbance was likely my fault even if he couldn’t [186] prove it. I cussed him out too. My shootin’</p>
      <p>off my mouth that time probably cost me twenty dollars or so. Well worth it, too.”</p>
      <p>He chuckled a while to himself, remembering, then turned his head on his pillow and looked at</p>
      <p>me.</p>
      <p>“What I was wonderin’, Chief, are you biding your time towards the day you decide to lay into</p>
      <p>them?”</p>
      <p>“No,” I told him. “I couldn’t.”</p>
      <p>“Couldn’t tell them off? It’s easier than you think.”</p>
      <p>“You’re  … lot bigger, tougher’n I am,” I mumbled.</p>
      <p>“How’s that? I didn’t get you, Chief.”</p>
      <p>I worked some spit down in my throat. “You are bigger and tougher than I am. You can do it.”</p>
      <p>“Me?  Are  you  kidding?  Criminy,  look  at  you:  you  stand  a  head  taller’n  any  man  on  the  ward.</p>
      <p>There ain’t a man here you couldn’t turn every way but loose, and that’s a fact!”</p>
      <p>“No. I’m way too little. I used to be big, but not no more. You’re twice the size of me.”</p>
      <p>“Hoo  boy,  you  are  crazy,  aren’t  you?  The  first  thing  I  saw  when  I  came  in  this  place  was  you</p>
      <p>sitting over in that chair, big as a damn mountain. I tell you, I lived all over Klamath and Texas and</p>
      <p>Oklahoma and all over around Gallup, and I swear you’re the biggest Indian I ever saw.”</p>
      <p>“I’m  from  the  Columbia  Gorge,”  I  said,  and  he  waited  for  me  to  go  on.  “My  Papa  was  a  full</p>
      <p>Chief  and  his  name  was  Tee  Ah  Millatoona.  That  means  The-Pine-That-Stands-Tallest-on-the-</p>
      <p>Mountain, and we didn’t live on a mountain. He was real big when I was a kid. My mother got twice</p>
      <p>his size.”</p>
      <p>“You must of had a real moose of an old lady. How big was she?”</p>
      <p>“Oh—big, big.”</p>
      <p>“I mean how many feet and inches?”</p>
      <p>“Feet  and  inches?  A  guy  at  the  carnival  looked  her  over  and  says  five  feet  nine  and  weight  a</p>
      <p>hundred and thirty pounds, but that was because he’d just saw her. She got bigger all the time.’”</p>
      <p>“Yeah? How much bigger?”</p>
      <p>“Bigger than Papa and me together.”</p>
      <p>“Just  one  day  took to  growin’,  huh?  Well,  that’s  a new  one on  me:  I  never  heard of  an  Indian</p>
      <p>woman doing something like that.”</p>
      <p>“She wasn’t Indian. She was a town woman from The Dalles.”</p>
      <p>“And her name was what? Bromden? Yeah, I see, wait a minute.” He thinks for a while and says,</p>
      <p>“And when a town [187] woman marries an Indian that’s marryin’ somebody beneath her, ain’t it?</p>
      <p>Yeah, I think I see.”</p>
      <p>“No. It wasn’t just her that made him little. Everybody worked on him because he was big, and</p>
      <p>wouldn’t give in, and did like he pleased. Everybody worked on him just the way they’re working on</p>
      <p>you.”</p>
      <p>“They who, Chief?” he asked in a soft voice, suddenly serious.</p>
      <p>“The Combine. It worked on him for years. He was big enough to fight it for a while. It wanted</p>
      <p>us to live in inspected houses. It wanted to take the falls. It was even in the tribe, and they worked</p>
      <p>on him. In the town they beat him up in the alleys and cut his hair short once. Oh, the Combine’s</p>
      <p>big—big. He fought it a long time till my mother made him too little to fight any more and he gave</p>
      <p>up.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy  didn’t  say  anything  for  a  long  time  after  that. Then  he raised  up  on  his  elbow  and</p>
      <p>looked at me again, and asked why they beat him up in the alleys, and I told him that they wanted to</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>123</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>make him see what he had in store for him only worse if he didn’t sign the papers giving everything</p>
      <p>to the government.</p>
      <p>“What did they want him to give to the government?”</p>
      <p>“Everything. The tribe, the village, the falls ...”</p>
      <p>“Now I remember; you’re talking about the falls where the Indians used to spear salmon—long</p>
      <p>time ago. Yeah. But the way I remember it the tribe got paid some huge amount.”</p>
      <p>“That’s what they said to him. He said, What can you pay for the way a man lives? He said, What</p>
      <p>can you pay for what a man is? They didn’t understand. Not even the tribe. They stood out in front</p>
      <p>of our door all holding those checks and they wanted him to tell them what to do now. They kept</p>
      <p>asking  him  to  invest  for  them,  or  tell  them  where  to  go,  or  to  buy  a  farm.  But  he  was  too  little</p>
      <p>anymore. And he was too drunk, too. The Combine had whipped him. It beats everybody. It’ll beat</p>
      <p>you too. They can’t have somebody as big as Papa running around unless he’s one of them. You can</p>
      <p>see that.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, I reckon I can.”</p>
      <p>“That’s why you shouldn’t of broke that window. They see you’re big, now. Now they got to bust</p>
      <p>you.”</p>
      <p>“Like bustin’ a mustang, huh?”</p>
      <p>“No. No, listen. They don’t bust you that way; they work on you ways you can’t fight! They put</p>
      <p>things in! They install things. They start as quick as they see you’re gonna be big and go to working</p>
      <p>and installing their filthy machinery when you’re little, and keep on and on and on till you’re fixed!”</p>
      <p>[188] “Take ‘er easy, buddy; shhh.”</p>
      <p>“And if you fight they lock you someplace and make you stop—”</p>
      <p>“Easy, easy, Chief. Just cool it for a while. They heard you.” He lay down and kept still. My bed</p>
      <p>was hot, I noticed. I could hear the squeak of rubber soles as the black boy came in with a flashlight</p>
      <p>to see what the noise was. We lay still till he left.</p>
      <p>“He finally just drank,” I whispered. I didn’t seem to be able to stop talking, not till I finished</p>
      <p>telling what I thought was all of it. “And the last I see him he’s blind in the cedars from drinking and</p>
      <p>every time I see him put the bottle to his mouth he don’t suck out of it, it sucks out of him until he’s</p>
      <p>shrunk so wrinkled and yellow even the dogs don’t know him, and we had to cart him out of the</p>
      <p>cedars, in a pickup, to a place in Portland, to die. I’m not saying they kill. They didn’t kill him. They</p>
      <p>did something else.”</p>
      <p>I was feeling awfully sleepy. I didn’t want to talk any more. I tried to think back on what I’d been</p>
      <p>saying, and it didn’t seem like what I’d wanted to say.</p>
      <p>“I been talking crazy, ain’t I?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, Chief”—he rolled over in his bed—“you been talkin’ crazy.”</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t what I wanted to say. I can’t say it all. It don’t make sense.”</p>
      <p>“I didn’t say it didn’t make sense, Chief, I just said it was talkin’ crazy.”</p>
      <p>He didn’t say anything after that for so long I thought he’d gone to sleep. I wished I’d told him</p>
      <p>good  night.  I  looked  over  at  him,  and  he  was  turned  away  from  me.  His  arm  wasn’t  under  the</p>
      <p>covers, and I could just make out the aces and eights tattooed there. It’s big, I thought, big as my</p>
      <p>arms used to be when I played football. I wanted to reach over and touch the place where he was</p>
      <p>tattooed, to see if he was still alive. He’s layin’ awful quiet, I told myself, I ought to touch him to see</p>
      <p>if he’s still alive. ...</p>
      <p>That’s a lie. I know he’s still alive. That ain’t the reason I want to touch him.</p>
      <p>I want to touch him because he’s a man.</p>
      <p>That’s a lie too. There’s other men around. I could touch them.</p>
      <p>I want to touch him because I’m one of these queers!</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>124</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>But that’s a lie too. That’s one fear hiding behind another. If I was one of these queers I’d want</p>
      <p>to do other things with him. I just want to touch him because he’s who he is.</p>
      <p>[189] But as I was about to reach over to that arm he said, “Say, Chief,” and rolled in bed with a</p>
      <p>lurch of covers, facing me, “Say, Chief, why don’t you come on this fishin’ trip with us tomorrow?”</p>
      <p>I didn’t answer.</p>
      <p>“Come on, what do ya say? I look for it to be one hell of an occasion. You know these two aunts</p>
      <p>of mine comin’ to pick us up? Why, those ain’t aunts, man, no; both those girls are workin’ shimmy</p>
      <p>dancers and hustlers I know from Portland. What do you say to that?”</p>
      <p>I finally told him I was one of the Indigents.</p>
      <p>“You’re what?”</p>
      <p>“I’m broke.”</p>
      <p>“Oh,” he said. “Yeah, I hadn’t thought of that.”</p>
      <p>He was quiet for a time again, rubbing that scar on his nose with his finger. The finger stopped.</p>
      <p>He raised up on his elbow and looked at me.</p>
      <p>“Chief,” he said slowly, looking me over, “when you were full-sized, when you used to be, let’s</p>
      <p>say, six seven or eight and weighed two eighty or so—were you strong enough to, say, lift something</p>
      <p>the size of that control panel in the tub room?”</p>
      <p>I thought about that panel. It probably didn’t weigh a lot more’n oil drums I’d lifted in the Army.</p>
      <p>I told him I probably could of at one time.</p>
      <p>“If you got that big again, could you still lift it?”</p>
      <p>I told him I thought so.</p>
      <p>“To hell with what you think; I want to know can you promise to lift it if I get you big as you used</p>
      <p>to be? You promise me that, and you not only get my special body-buildin’ course for nothing but</p>
      <p>you get yourself a ten-buck fishin’ trip, free!” He licked his lips and lay back. “Get me good odds too,</p>
      <p>I bet.”</p>
      <p>He lay there chuckling over some thought of his own. When I asked him how he was going to</p>
      <p>get me big again he shushed me with a finger to his lips.</p>
      <p>“Man, we can’t let a secret like this out. I didn’t say I’d tell you how, did I? Hoo boy, blowin’ a</p>
      <p>man back up to full size is a secret you can’t share with everybody, be dangerous in the hands of an</p>
      <p>enemy. You won’t even know it’s happening most of the time yourself. But I give you my solemn</p>
      <p>word, you follow my training program, and here’s what’ll happen.”</p>
      <p>He  swung  his  legs  out  of  bed  and  sat on the  edge  with  his  hands  on  his  knees.  The  dim  light</p>
      <p>coming in over his shoulder from the Nurses’ Station caught the shine of his teeth and the [190] one</p>
      <p>eye glinting down his nose at me. The rollicking auctioneer’s voice spun softly through the dorm.</p>
      <p>“There you’ll be. It’s the Big Chief Bromden, cuttin’ down the boulevard—men, women, and kids</p>
      <p>rockin’ back on their heels to peer at him: ‘Well well well, what giant’s this here, takin’ ten feet at a</p>
      <p>step  and  duckin’  for telephone  wires?’  Comes  stompin’  through  town,  stops  just  long  enough  for</p>
      <p>virgins, the rest of you twitches might’s well not even line up ‘less you got tits like muskmelons, nice</p>
      <p>strong white legs long enough to lock around his mighty back, and a little cup of poozle warm and</p>
      <p>juicy and sweet as butter an’ honey ...”</p>
      <p>In the dark there he went on, spinning his tale about how it would be, with all the men scared</p>
      <p>and  all  the  beautiful  young  girls  panting  after  me.  Then  he  said  he  was  going  out  right  this  very</p>
      <p>minute  and  sign  my  name  up  as  one  of  his  fishing  crew.  He  stood  up,  got  the  towel  from  his</p>
      <p>bedstand and wrapped it around his hips and put on his cap, and stood over my bed.</p>
      <p>“Oh man, I tell you, I tell you, you’ll have women trippin’ you and beatin’ you to the floor.”</p>
      <p>And all of a sudden his hand shot out and with a swing of his arm untied my sheet, cleared my</p>
      <p>bed of covers, and left me lying there naked.</p>
      <p>“Look there, Chief. Haw. What’d I tell ya? You growed a half a foot already.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>125</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>Laughing, he walked down the row of beds to the hall.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>126</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>25</p>
      <p>Two whores on their way down from Portland to take us deep-sea fishing in a boat! It made it</p>
      <p>tough to stay in bed until the dorm lights came on at six-thirty.</p>
      <p>I was the first one up out of the dorm to look at the list posted on the board next to the Nurses’</p>
      <p>Station,  check  to  see  if  my  name  was  really  signed  there.  SIGN  UP  FOR  DEEP  SEA  FISHING  was</p>
      <p>printed in big letters at the top, then McMurphy had signed first and Billy Bibbit was number one,</p>
      <p>right  after  McMurphy.  Number  three  was  Harding  and  number  four  was  Fredrickson,  and  all  the</p>
      <p>way down to number ten where nobody’d signed yet. My name was there, the last put down, across</p>
      <p>from the number nine. I was actually going out of the hospital with two whores on a fishing boat; I</p>
      <p>had to keep saying it over and over to myself to believe it.</p>
      <p>The three black boys slipped up in front of me and read the list with gray fingers, found my name</p>
      <p>there and turned to grin at me.</p>
      <p>“Why,  who  you  s’pose  signed  Chief  Bromden  up  for  this  foolishness?  Inniuns  ain’t  able  to</p>
      <p>write.”</p>
      <p>“What makes you think Inniuns able to read?”</p>
      <p>The  starch  was  still  fresh  and  stiff  enough  this  early  that  their  arms  rustled  in  the  white  suits</p>
      <p>when they moved, like paper wings. I acted deaf to them laughing at me, like I didn’t even know, but</p>
      <p>when they stuck a broom out for me to do their work up the hall, I turned around and walked back</p>
      <p>to the dorm, telling myself, The hell with that. A man goin’ fishing with two whores from Portland</p>
      <p>don’t have to take that crap.</p>
      <p>It scared me some, walking off from them like that, because I never went against what the black</p>
      <p>boys ordered before. I looked back and saw them coming after me with the broom. They’d probably</p>
      <p>have come right on in the dorm and got me but for McMurphy; he was in there making such a fuss,</p>
      <p>roaring up and down between the beds, snapping a towel at the guys signed to go this morning, that</p>
      <p>the black boys decided maybe the dorm wasn’t such safe territory to venture into for no more than</p>
      <p>somebody to sweep a little dab of hallway.</p>
      <p>McMurphy had his motorcycle cap pulled way forward on [192] his red hair to look like a boat</p>
      <p>captain, and the tattoos showing out from the sleeves of his T-shirt were done in Singapore. He was</p>
      <p>swaggering  around  the  floor  like  it  was  the  deck  of  a  ship,  whistling  in  his  hand  like  a  bosun’s</p>
      <p>whistle.</p>
      <p>“Hit the deck, mateys, hit the deck or I keelhaul the lot of ye from stock to stern!”</p>
      <p>He rang the bedstand next to Harding’s bed with his knuckles.</p>
      <p>“Six bells and all’s well. Steady as she goes. Hit the deck. Drop your cocks and grab your socks.”</p>
      <p>He noticed me standing just inside the doorway and came rushing over to thump my back like a</p>
      <p>drum.</p>
      <p>“Look here at the Big Chief; here’s an example of a good sailor and fisherman: up before day and</p>
      <p>out diggin’ red worms for bait. The rest of you scurvy bunch o’ lubbers’d do well to follow his lead.</p>
      <p>Hit the deck. Today’s the day! Outa the sack and into the sea!”</p>
      <p>The Acutes grumbled and griped at him and his towel, and the Chronics woke up to look around</p>
      <p>with beads blue from lack of blood cut off by sheets tied too tight across the chest, looking around</p>
      <p>the dorm till they finally centered on me with weak and watered-down old looks, faces wistful and</p>
      <p>curious. They lay there watching me pull on warm clothes for the trip, making me feel uneasy and a</p>
      <p>little  guilty.  They  could  sense  I  had  been  singled  out  as  the  only  Chronic  making  the  trip.  They</p>
      <p>watched  me—old  guys  welded  in  wheelchairs  for  years,  with  catheters  down  their  legs  like  vines</p>
      <p>rooting them for the rest of their lives right where they are, they watched me and knew instinctively</p>
      <p>that I  was  going.  And  they  could  still  be  a  little  jealous  it  wasn’t  them.  They  could  know  because</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>127</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>enough of the man in them had been damped out that the old animal instincts had taken over (old</p>
      <p>Chronics  wake  up  sudden  some  nights, before  anybody else  knows  a  guy’s  died  in  the  dorm,  and</p>
      <p>throw back their heads and howl), and they could be jealous because there was enough man left to</p>
      <p>still remember.</p>
      <p>McMurphy  went  out  to  look  at  the  list  and  came  back  and  tried  to  talk  one  more  Acute  into</p>
      <p>signing, going down the line kicking at the beds still had guys in them with sheets pulled over their</p>
      <p>heads, telling them what a great thing it was to be out there in the teeth of the gale with a he-man</p>
      <p>sea  crackin’  around  and  a  goddam  yo-heave-ho  and  a  bottle  of  rum.  “C’mon,  loafers,  I  need one</p>
      <p>more mate to round out the crew, I need one more goddam volunteer. ...”</p>
      <p>But he couldn’t talk anybody into it. The Big Nurse had the rest scared with her stories of how</p>
      <p>rough the sea’d been lately [193] and how many boats’d sunk, and it didn’t look like we’d get that</p>
      <p>last  crew  member  till  a  half-hour  later  when  George  Sorensen  came  up  to  McMurphy  in  the</p>
      <p>breakfast line where we were waiting for the mess hall to be unlocked for breakfast.</p>
      <p>Big  toothless  knotty  old  Swede  the  black  boys  called  Rub-adub  George,  because  of  his  thing</p>
      <p>about sanitation, came shuffling up the hall, listing well back so his feet went well out in front of his</p>
      <p>head (sways backward this way to keep his face as far away from the man he’s talking to as he can),</p>
      <p>stopped  in  front  of  McMurphy,  and  mumbled  something  in  his  hand.  George  was  very  shy.  You</p>
      <p>couldn’t  see  his  eyes  because  they  were  in  so  deep  under  his  brow,  and  he  cupped  his  big  palm</p>
      <p>around most of the rest of his face. His head swayed like a crow’s nest on top of his mastlike spine.</p>
      <p>He mumbled in his hand till McMurphy finally reached up and pulled the hand away so’s the words</p>
      <p>could get out.</p>
      <p>“Now, George, what is it you’re sayin’?”</p>
      <p>“Red worms,” he was saying. “I joost don’t think they do you no good—not for the Chin-nook.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah?” McMurphy said. “Red worms? I might agree with you, George, if you let me know what</p>
      <p>about these red worms you’re speaking of.”</p>
      <p>“I think joost a while ago I hear you say Mr. Bromden was out digging the red worms for bait.”</p>
      <p>“That’s right, Pop, I remember.”</p>
      <p>“So I joost say you don’t have you no good fortune with them worms. This here is the month</p>
      <p>with  one  big  Chinook  run—su-ure.  Herring  you  need.  Su-ure.  You  jig  you  some  herring  and  use</p>
      <p>those fellows for bait, then you have some good fortune.”</p>
      <p>His voice went up at the end of every sentence—for-chune—like he was asking a question. His big</p>
      <p>chin,  already  scrubbed  so  much  this  morning  he’d  worn  the  hide  off  it,  nodded  up  and  down  at</p>
      <p>McMurphy once or twice, then turned him around to lead him down the hall toward the end of the</p>
      <p>line. McMurphy called him back.</p>
      <p>“Now, hold ‘er a minute, George; you talk like you know something about this fishin’ business.”</p>
      <p>George  turned  and  shuffled  back  to  McMurphy,  listing  back  so  far  it  looked  like  his  feet  had</p>
      <p>navigated right out from under him.</p>
      <p>“You bet, su-ure. Twenty-five year I work the Chinook trollers, all the way from Half Moon Bay</p>
      <p>to Puget Sound. Twenty-five year I fish—before I get so dirty.” He held out his hands for us to see</p>
      <p>the dirt on them. Everybody around leaned over [194] and looked. I didn’t see the dirt but I did see</p>
      <p>scars worn deep into the white palms from hauling a thousand miles of fishing line out of the sea.</p>
      <p>He let us look a minute, then rolled the hands shut and drew them away and hid them in his pajama</p>
      <p>shirt  like  we  might  dirty  them  looking,  and  stood  grinning  at  McMurphy  with  gums  like  brine-</p>
      <p>bleached pork.</p>
      <p>“I had a good troller boat, joost forty feet, but she drew twelve feet water and she was solid teak</p>
      <p>and solid oak.” He rocked back and forth in a way to make you doubt that the floor was standing</p>
      <p>level. “She was one good troller boat, by golly!”</p>
      <p>He started to turn, but McMurphy stopped him again.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>128</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Hell, George, why didn’t you say you were a fisherman? I been talking up this voyage like I was</p>
      <p>the Old Man of the Sea, but just between you an’ me an’ the wall there, the only boat I been on was</p>
      <p>the  battleship  Missouri  and  the  only  thing  I  know  about  fish  is  that  I  like  eatin’  ‘em  better  than</p>
      <p>cleanin’ ‘em.”</p>
      <p>“Cleanin’ is easy, somebody show you how.”</p>
      <p>“By God, you’re gonna be our captain, George; we’ll be your crew.”</p>
      <p>George tilted back, shaking his head. “Those boats awful dirty any more—everything awful dirty.”</p>
      <p>“The hell with that. We got a boat specially sterilized fore and aft, swabbed clean as a bound’s</p>
      <p>tooth. You won’t get dirty, George, ‘cause you’ll be the captain. Won’t even have to bait a hook; just</p>
      <p>be our captain and give orders to us dumb landlubbers—how’s that strike you?”</p>
      <p>I could see George was tempted by the way he wrung his hands under his shirt, but he still said</p>
      <p>he couldn’t risk getting dirty. McMurphy did his best to talk him into it, but George was still shaking</p>
      <p>his head when the Big Nurse’s key hit the lock of the mess hall and she came jangling out the door</p>
      <p>with her wicker bag of surprises, clicked down the line with automatic smile-and-good-morning for</p>
      <p>each man she passed. McMurphy noticed the way George leaned back from her and scowled. When</p>
      <p>she’d passed, McMurphy tilted his head and gave George the one bright eye.</p>
      <p>“George, that stuff the nurse has been saying about the bad sea, about how terrible dangerous</p>
      <p>this trip might be—what about that?”</p>
      <p>“That ocean could be awful bad, sure, awful rough.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy looked down at the nurse disappearing into the station, then back at George. George</p>
      <p>started twisting his hands [195] around in his shirt more than ever, looking around at the silent faces</p>
      <p>watching him.</p>
      <p>“By golly!” he said suddenly. “You think I let her scare me about that ocean? You think that?”</p>
      <p>“Ah, I guess not, George. I was thinking, though, that if you don’t come along with us, and if</p>
      <p>there is some awful stormy calamity, we’re every last one of us liable to be lost at sea, you know that?</p>
      <p>I said I didn’t know nothin’ about boating, and I’ll tell you something else: these two women coming</p>
      <p>to  get  us,  I  told  the  doctor  was  my  two  aunts,  two  widows  of  fishermen.  Well,  the  only  cruisin’</p>
      <p>either one of them ever did was on solid cement. They won’t be no more help in a fix than me. We</p>
      <p>need you, George.” He took a pull on his cigarette and asked, “You got ten bucks, by the way?”</p>
      <p>George shook his head.</p>
      <p>“No, I wouldn’t suppose so. Well, what the devil, I gave up the idea of comin’ out ahead days</p>
      <p>ago. Here.” He took a pencil out of the pocket of his green jacket and wiped it clean on his shirttail,</p>
      <p>held it out to George. “You captain us, and we’ll let you come along for five.”</p>
      <p>George looked around at us again, working his big brow over the predicament. Finally his gums</p>
      <p>showed in a bleached smile and he reached for the pencil. “By golly!” he said and headed off with</p>
      <p>the  pencil  to  sign  the  last  place  on  the  list.  After  breakfast,  walking  down  the  hall,  McMurphy</p>
      <p>stopped and printed C-A-P-T behind George’s name.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>The  whores  were  late.  Everybody  was  beginning  to  think  they  weren’t  coming  at  all  when</p>
      <p>McMurphy gave a yell from the window and we all went running to look. He said that was them, but</p>
      <p>we didn’t see but one car, instead of the two we were counting on, and just one woman. McMurphy</p>
      <p>called to her through the screen when she stopped on the parking lot, and she came cutting straight</p>
      <p>across the grass toward our ward.</p>
      <p>She was younger and prettier than any of us’d figured on. Everybody had found out that the girls</p>
      <p>were  whores  instead  of  aunts,  and  were  expecting  all  sorts  of  things.  Some  of  the  religious  guys</p>
      <p>weren’t  any  too  happy  about  it.  But  seeing  her  coming  lightfooted  across  the  grass  with  her  eyes</p>
      <p>green all the way up to the ward, and her hair, roped in a long twist at the back of her head, jouncing</p>
      <p>up and down with every step like copper springs in the sun, all any of us could think of was that she</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>129</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>was a girl, a female who wasn’t dressed white from head to foot like she’d been dipped in frost, and</p>
      <p>how she made her money didn’t make any difference.</p>
      <p>[196] She ran right up against the screen where McMurphy was and hooked her fingers through</p>
      <p>the mesh and pulled herself against it. She was panting from the run, and every breath looked like</p>
      <p>she might swell right through the mesh. She was crying a little.</p>
      <p>“McMurphy, oh, you damned McMurphy ...”</p>
      <p>“Never mind that. Where’s Sandra?”</p>
      <p>“She got tied up, man, can’t make it. But you, damn it, are you okay?”</p>
      <p>“She got tied up!”</p>
      <p>“To tell the truth”—the girl wiped her nose and giggled”—ol’ Sandy got married. You remember</p>
      <p>Artie  Gilfillian  from  Beaverton?  Always  used  to  show  up  at  the  parties  with  some  gassy  thing,  a</p>
      <p>gopher snake or a white mouse or some gassy thing like that in his pocket? A real maniac—”</p>
      <p>“Oh, sweet Jesus!” McMurphy groaned. “How’m I supposed to get ten guys in one stinkin’ Ford,</p>
      <p>Candy  sweetheart?  How’d  Sandra  and  her  gopher  snake  from  Beaverton  figure  on  me  swinging</p>
      <p>that?”</p>
      <p>The  girl  looked  like  she  was  in  the  process  of  thinking  up  an  answer  when  the  speaker  in  the</p>
      <p>ceiling clacked and the Big Nurse’s voice told McMurphy if he wanted to talk with his lady friend</p>
      <p>it’d be better if she signed in properly at the main door instead of disturbing the whole hospital. The</p>
      <p>girl left the screen and started toward the main entrance, and McMurphy left the screen and flopped</p>
      <p>down in a chair in the corner, his head hanging. “Hell’s bells,” he said.</p>
      <p>The least black boy let the girl onto the ward and forgot to lock the door behind her (caught hell</p>
      <p>for  it  later,  I  bet),  and  the  girl  came  jouncing  up  the  hall  past  the  Nurses’  Station,  where  all  the</p>
      <p>nurses  were  trying  to  freeze her  bounce  with  a  united  icy  look,  and  into  the  day  room  just  a  few</p>
      <p>steps ahead of the doctor. He was going toward the Nurses’ Station with some papers, looked at her,</p>
      <p>and  back  at  the  papers,  and  back  at  her  again,  and  went  to  fumbling  after  his  glasses  with  both</p>
      <p>hands.</p>
      <p>She stopped when she got to the middle of the day-room floor and saw she was circled by forty</p>
      <p>staring men in green, and it was so quiet you could hear bellies growling, and, all along the Chronic</p>
      <p>row, hear catheters popping off.</p>
      <p>She had to stand there a minute while she looked around to find McMurphy, so everybody got a</p>
      <p>long  look  at  her.  There  was  a  blue  smoke  hung  near  the  ceiling  over  her  bead;  I  think  apparatus</p>
      <p>burned out all over the ward trying to adjust to her come busting in like she did—took electronic</p>
      <p>readings on her [197] and calculated they weren’t built to handle something like this on the ward,</p>
      <p>and just burned out, like machines committing suicide.</p>
      <p>She had on a white T-shirt like McMurphy’s only a lot smaller, white tennis shoes and Levi pants</p>
      <p>snipped off above her knees to give her feet circulation, and it didn’t look like that was near enough</p>
      <p>material to go around, considering what it had to cover. She must’ve been seen with lots less by lots</p>
      <p>more men, but under the circumstances she began to, fidget around self-consciously like a schoolgirl</p>
      <p>on a stage. Nobody spoke while they looked. Martini did whisper that you could read the dates of</p>
      <p>the coins in her Levi pockets, they were so tight, but he was closer and could see better’n the rest of</p>
      <p>us.</p>
      <p>Billy  Bibbit  was  the  first  one  to  say  something  out  loud,  not  really  a  word,  just  a  low,  almost</p>
      <p>painful whistle that described how she looked better than anybody else could have. She laughed and</p>
      <p>thanked him very much and he blushed so red that she blushed with him and laughed again. This</p>
      <p>broke things  into  movement. All  the  Acutes  were coming  across  the  floor  trying  to talk  to  her  at</p>
      <p>once.  The  doctor  was  pulling  on  Harding’s  coat,  asking  who  is  this.  McMurphy  got  up out  of his</p>
      <p>chair and walked through the crowd to her, and when she saw him she threw her arms around him</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>130</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>and  said,  “You  damned  McMurphy,”  and  then  got  embarrassed  and  blushed  again.  When  she</p>
      <p>blushed she didn’t look more than sixteen or seventeen, I swear she didn’t.</p>
      <p>McMurphy introduced her around and she shook everybody’s hand. When she got to Billy she</p>
      <p>thanked him again for his whistle. The Big Nurse came sliding out of the station, smiling, and asked</p>
      <p>McMurphy how he intended to get all ten of us in one car, and he asked could he maybe borrow a</p>
      <p>staff car and drive a load himself, and the nurse cited a rule forbidding this, just like everyone knew</p>
      <p>she would. She said unless there was another driver to sign a Responsibility Slip that half of the crew</p>
      <p>would have to stay behind. McMurphy told her this’d cost him fifty goddam bucks to make up the</p>
      <p>difference; he’d have to pay the guys back who didn’t get to go.</p>
      <p>“Then  it  may  be,”  the  nurse  said,  “that  the  trip  will  have  to  be  canceled—and  all  the  money</p>
      <p>refunded.”</p>
      <p>“I’ve already rented the boat; the man’s got seventy bucks of mine in his pocket right now!”</p>
      <p>“Seventy dollars? So? I thought you told the patients you’d need to collect a hundred dollars plus</p>
      <p>ten of your own to finance the trip, Mr. McMurphy.”</p>
      <p>“I was putting gas in the cars over and back.”</p>
      <p>[198] “That wouldn’t amount to thirty dollars, though, would it?”</p>
      <p>She smiled so nice at him, waiting. He threw his hands in the air and looked at the ceiling.</p>
      <p>“Hoo boy, you don’t miss a chance do you, Miss District Attorney. Sure; I was keepin’ what was</p>
      <p>left over. I don’t think any of the guys ever thought any different. I figured to make a little for the</p>
      <p>trouble I took get—”</p>
      <p>“But  your  plans  didn’t  work  out,”  she  said.  She  was  still  smiling  at  him,  so  full  of  sympathy.</p>
      <p>“Your little financial speculations can’t all be successes, Randle, and, actually, as I think about it now,</p>
      <p>you’ve had more than your share of victories.” She mused about this, thinking about something I</p>
      <p>knew we’d hear more about later. “Yes. Every Acute on the ward has written you an IOU for some</p>
      <p>‘deal’  of  yours  at  one  time  or  another,  so  don’t  you  think  you  can  bear  up  under  this  one  small</p>
      <p>defeat?”</p>
      <p>Then  she  stopped.  She  saw  McMurphy  wasn’t  listening  to  her  any  more.  He  was  watching  the</p>
      <p>doctor.  And  the  doctor  was  eying  the  blond  girl’s  T-shirt  like  nothing  else  existed.  McMurphy’s</p>
      <p>loose smile spread out on his face as he watched the doctor’s trance, and he pushed his cap to the</p>
      <p>back of his head and strolled to the doctor’s side, startling him with a hand on the shoulder.</p>
      <p>“By God, Doctor Spivey, you ever see a Chinook salmon hit a line? One of the fiercest sights on</p>
      <p>the seven seas. Say, Candy honeybun, whyn’t you tell the doctor here about deep-sea fishing and all</p>
      <p>like that. ...”</p>
      <p>Working together, it didn’t take McMurphy and the girl but two minutes and the little doctor was</p>
      <p>down locking up his office and coming back up the hall, cramming papers in a brief case.</p>
      <p>“Good deal of paper work I can get done on the boat,” he explained to the nurse and went past</p>
      <p>her so fast she didn’t have a chance to answer, and the rest of the crew followed, slower, grinning at</p>
      <p>her standing in the door of that Nurses’ Station.</p>
      <p>The Acutes who weren’t going gathered at the day-room door, told us don’t bring our catch back</p>
      <p>till it’s cleaned, and Ellis pulled his hands down off the nails in the wall and squeezed Billy Bibbit’s</p>
      <p>hand and told him to be a fisher of men.</p>
      <p>And Billy, watching the brass brads on that woman’s Levis wink at him as she walked out of the</p>
      <p>day room, told Ellis to hell with that fisher of men business. He joined us at the door, and the least</p>
      <p>black boy let us through and locked the door behind us, and we were out, outside.</p>
      <p>[199] The sun was prying up the clouds and lighting the brick front of the hospital rose bed. A</p>
      <p>thin breeze worked at sawing what leaves were left from the oak trees, stacking them neatly against</p>
      <p>the wire cyclone fence. There was little brown birds occasionally on the fence; when a puff of leaves</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>131</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>would  hit  the  fence  the  birds  would  fly  off  with  the  wind.  It  looked  at  first  like  the  leaves  were</p>
      <p>hitting the fence and turning into birds and flying away.</p>
      <p>It was a fine woodsmoked autumn day, full of the sound of kids punting footballs and the putter</p>
      <p>of small airplanes, and everybody should’ve been happy just being outside in it. But we all stood in a</p>
      <p>silent bunch with our hands in our pockets while the doctor walked to get his car. A silent bunch,</p>
      <p>watching the townspeople who were driving past on their way to work slow down to gawk at all the</p>
      <p>loonies in green uniforms. McMurphy saw how uneasy we were and tried to work us into a better</p>
      <p>mood by joking and teasing the girl, but this made us feel worse somehow. Everybody was thinking</p>
      <p>how easy it would be to return to the ward, go back and say they decided the nurse had been right;</p>
      <p>with a wind like this the sea would’ve been just too rough.</p>
      <p>The  doctor  arrived  and  we  loaded  up  and  headed  off,  me  and  George  and  Harding  and  Billy</p>
      <p>Bibbit in the car with McMurphy and the girl, Candy; and Fredrickson and Sefelt and Scanlon and</p>
      <p>Martini  and  Tadem  and  Gregory  following  in  the  doctor’s  car.  Everyone  was  awfully  quiet.  We</p>
      <p>pulled into a gas station about a mile from the hospital; the doctor followed. He got out first, and</p>
      <p>the  service-station  man  came  bouncing  out,  grinning  and  wiping  his  hands  on  a  rag.  Then  he</p>
      <p>stopped grinning and went past the doctor to see just what was in these cars. He backed off, wiping</p>
      <p>his hands on the oily rag, frowning. The doctor caught the man’s sleeve nervously and took out a</p>
      <p>ten-dollar bill and tucked it down in the man’s hands like setting out a tomato plant.</p>
      <p>“Ah,  would  you  fill  both  tanks  with  regular?”  the  doctor  asked.  He  was  acting  just  as  uneasy</p>
      <p>about being out of the hospital as the rest of us were. “Ah, would you?”</p>
      <p>“Those  uniforms,”  the  service-station  man  said,  “they’re  from  the  hospital  back  up  the  road,</p>
      <p>aren’t  they?”  He  was  looking  around  him  to  see  if  there  was  a  wrench  or  something  handy.  He</p>
      <p>finally moved over near a stack of empty pop bottles. “You guys are from that asylum.”</p>
      <p>The  doctor  fumbled  for  his  glasses  and  looked  at  us  too,  like  he’d  just  noticed  the  uniforms.</p>
      <p>“Yes.  No,  I mean.  We,  they  [200]  are  from  the  asylum,  but  they  are  a  work  crew, not  inmates, of</p>
      <p>course not. A work crew.”</p>
      <p>The man squinted at the doctor and at us and went off to whisper to his partner, who was back</p>
      <p>among the machinery. They talked a minute, and the second guy hollered and asked the doctor who</p>
      <p>we were and the doctor repeated that we were a work crew, and both of the guys laughed. I could</p>
      <p>tell  by  the  laugh  that  they’d  decided  to  sell  us  the  gas—probably  it  would  be  weak  and  dirty  and</p>
      <p>watered  down  and  cost  twice  the  usual  price—but  it  didn’t  make  me  feel  any  better.  I  could  see</p>
      <p>everybody was feeling pretty bad. The doctor’s lying made us feel worse than ever—not because of</p>
      <p>the lie, so much, but because of the truth.</p>
      <p>The  second  guy  came  over to the  doctor,  grinning.  “You  said  you  wanted  the  Soo-preme,  sir?</p>
      <p>You bet. And how about us checking those oil filters and windshield wipes?” He was bigger than his</p>
      <p>friend. He leaned down on the doctor like he was  sharing a secret. “Would you believe it: eighty-</p>
      <p>eight per cent of the cars show by the figures on the road today that they need new oil filters and</p>
      <p>windshield wipes?”</p>
      <p>His  grin  was  coated  with  carbon  from  years  of  taking  out  spark  plugs  with  his  teeth.  He  kept</p>
      <p>leaning down on the doctor, making him squirm with that grin and waiting for him to admit he was</p>
      <p>over a barrel. “Also, how’s your work crew fixed for sunglasses? We got some good Polaroids.” The</p>
      <p>doctor knew he had him. But just the instant he opened his mouth, about to give in and say Yes,</p>
      <p>anything,  there  was  a  whirring  noise  and  the  top  of  our  car  was  folding  back.  McMurphy  was</p>
      <p>fighting  and  cursing  the  accordion-pleated  top,  trying  to  force  it  back  faster  than  the  machinery</p>
      <p>could  handle  it.  Everybody  could  see  how  mad  he  was  by  the  way  he  thrashed  and  beat  at  that</p>
      <p>slowly  rising  top;  when  he  got  it  cussed  and hammered  and  wrestled  down  into  place he  climbed</p>
      <p>right  out  over  the  girl  and  over  the  side  of  the  car  and  walked  up  between  the  doctor  and  the</p>
      <p>service-station guy and looked up into the black mouth with one eye.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>132</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Okay now, Hank, we’ll take regular, just like the doctor ordered. Two tanks of regular. That’s all.</p>
      <p>The  hell  with  that  other  slum.  And  we’ll  take  it  at  three  cents  off  because  we’re  a  goddamned</p>
      <p>government-sponsored expedition.”</p>
      <p>The guy didn’t budge. “Yeah? I thought the professor here said you weren’t patients?”</p>
      <p>“Now Hank, don’t you see that was just a kindly precaution to keep from startlin’ you folks with</p>
      <p>the  truth?  The  doc  wouldn’t  lie  like  that  about  just  any  patients,  but  we  ain’t  [201]  ordinary  nuts;</p>
      <p>we’re every bloody one of us hot off the criminal-insane ward, on our way to San Quentin where</p>
      <p>they got better facilities to handle us. You see that freckle-faced kid there? Now he might look like</p>
      <p>he’s right off a Saturday Evening Post cover, but he’s a insane knife artist that killed three men. The</p>
      <p>man beside him is known as the Bull Goose Loony, unpredictable as a wild hog. You see that big</p>
      <p>guy? He’s an Indian and he beat six white men to death with a pick handle when they tried to cheat</p>
      <p>him trading muskrat hides. Stand up where they can get a look at you, Chief.”</p>
      <p>Harding goosed me with his thumb, and I stood up on the floor of the car. The guy shaded his</p>
      <p>eyes and looked up at me and didn’t say anything.</p>
      <p>“Oh,  it’s  a  bad  group,  I  admit,”  McMurphy  said,  “but  it’s  a  planned,  authorized,  legal</p>
      <p>government-sponsored excursion, and we’re entitled to a legal discount just the same as if we was</p>
      <p>the FBI.”</p>
      <p>The  guy  looked  back  at  McMurphy,  and  McMurphy  hooked  his  thumbs  in  his  pockets  and</p>
      <p>rocked back and looked up at him across the scar on his nose. The guy turned to check if his buddy</p>
      <p>was still stationed at the case of empty pop bottles, then grinned back down on McMurphy.</p>
      <p>“Pretty tough customers, is that what you’re saying, Red? So much we better toe the line and do</p>
      <p>what  we’re  told,  is  that  what  you’re  saying?  Well,  tell  me,  Red,  what  is  it  you’re  in  for?  Trying  to</p>
      <p>assassinate the President?”</p>
      <p>“Nobody could prove that, Hank. They got me on a bum rap. I killed a man in the ring, ya see, and</p>
      <p>sorta got taken with the kick.”</p>
      <p>“One of these killers with boxing gloves, is that what you’re telling me, Red?”</p>
      <p>“Now I didn’t say that, did I? I never could get used to those pillows you wore. No, this wasn’t</p>
      <p>no televised main event from the Cow Palace; I’m more what you call a back-lot boxer.”</p>
      <p>The  guy  hooked  his  thumbs  in  his  pockets  to  mock  McMurphy.  “You  are  more  what  I  call  a</p>
      <p>back-lot bull-thrower.”</p>
      <p>“Now I didn’t say that bull-throwing wasn’t also one of my abilities, did I? But I want you to look</p>
      <p>here.” He put his hands up in the guy’s face, real close, turning them over slowly, palm and knuckle.</p>
      <p>“You ever see a man get his poor old meathooks so pitiful chewed up from just throwin’ the bull?</p>
      <p>Did you, Hank?”</p>
      <p>He held those hands in the guy’s face a long time, waiting to see if the guy had anything else to</p>
      <p>say. The guy looked at [202] the hands, and at me, and back at the hands. When it was clear he didn’t</p>
      <p>have anything else real pressing to say, McMurphy walked away from him to the other guy leaning</p>
      <p>against  the  pop  cooler  and  plucked  the  doctor’s  ten-dollar  bill  out  of  his  fist  and  started  for  the</p>
      <p>grocery store next to the station.</p>
      <p>“You boys tally what the gas comes to and send the bill to the hospital,” he called back. “I intend</p>
      <p>to  use  the  cash  to  pick  up  some  refreshments  for  the  men.  I  believe  we’ll  get  that  in  place  of</p>
      <p>windshield wipes and eighty-eight per cent oil filters.”</p>
      <p>By the time he got back everybody was feeling cocky as fighting roosters and calling orders to the</p>
      <p>service-station  guys  to  check  the  air  in  the  spare  and  wipe  the  windows  and  scratch  that  bird</p>
      <p>dropping off the hood if you please, just like we owned the show. When the big guy didn’t get the</p>
      <p>windshield to suit Billy, Billy called him right back.</p>
      <p>“You didn’t get this sp-spot here where the bug h-h-hit “</p>
      <p>“That wasn’t a bug,” the guy said sullenly, scratching at it with his fingernail, “that was a bird.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>133</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>Martini called all the way from the other car that it couldn’t of been a bird. “There’d be feathers</p>
      <p>and bones if it was a bird.”</p>
      <p>A man riding a bicycle stopped to ask what was the idea of all the green uniforms; some kind of</p>
      <p>club? Harding popped right up and answered him</p>
      <p>“No, my friend. We are lunatics from the hospital up the highway, psycho-ceramics, the cracked</p>
      <p>pots of mankind. Would you like me to decipher a Rorschach for you? No? You must burry on? Ah,</p>
      <p>he’s gone. Pity.” He turned to McMurphy. “Never before did I realize that mental illness could have</p>
      <p>the  aspect  of  power,  power.  Think  of  it:  perhaps  the  more  insane  a  man  is,  the  more  powerful  he</p>
      <p>could become. Hitler an example. Fair makes the old brain reel, doesn’t it? Food for thought there.”</p>
      <p>Billy  punched  a  beer  can  for  the  girl,  and  she  flustered  him  so  with  her  bright  smile  and  her</p>
      <p>“Thank you, Billy,” that he took to opening cans for all of us.</p>
      <p>While the pigeons fretted up and down the sidewalk with their hands folded behind their backs.</p>
      <p>I  sat  there,  feeling  whole  and  good,  sipping  at  a  beer;  I  could  hear  the  beer  all  the  way  down</p>
      <p>me—zzzth zzzth, like that. I had forgotten that there can be good sounds and tastes like the sound</p>
      <p>and taste of a beer going down. I took another big drink and started looking around me to see what</p>
      <p>else I had forgotten in twenty years.</p>
      <p>[203]  “Man!”  McMurphy  said  as  he  scooted  the  girl  out  from  under  the  wheel  and  tight  over</p>
      <p>against Billy. “Will you just look at the Big Chief slug down on that firewater!”—and slammed the</p>
      <p>car out into traffic with the doctor squealing behind to keep up.</p>
      <p>He’d shown us what a little bravado and courage could accomplish, and we thought he’d taught</p>
      <p>us how to use it. All the way to the coast we had fun pretending to be brave. When people at a stop</p>
      <p>light would stare at us and our green uniforms we’d do just like he did, sit up straight and strong and</p>
      <p>toughlooking and put a big grin on our face and stare straight back at them till their motors died and</p>
      <p>their windows sunstreaked and they were left sitting when the light changed, upset bad by what a</p>
      <p>tough bunch of monkeys was just now not three feet from them, and help nowhere in sight.</p>
      <p>As McMurphy led the twelve of us toward the ocean.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>I think McMurphy knew better than we did that our tough looks were all show, because he still</p>
      <p>wasn’t able to get a real laugh out of anybody. Maybe he couldn’t understand why we weren’t able to</p>
      <p>laugh yet, but he knew you can’t really be strong until you can see a funny side to things. In fact, he</p>
      <p>worked so hard at pointing out the funny side of things that I was wondering a little if maybe he was</p>
      <p>blind to the other side, if maybe he wasn’t able to see what it was that parched laughter deep inside</p>
      <p>your stomach. Maybe the guys weren’t able to see it either, just feel the pressures of the different</p>
      <p>beams  and  frequencies  coming  from  all  directions,  working  to  push  and  bend  you  one  way  or</p>
      <p>another, feel the Combine at work—but I was able to see it.</p>
      <p>The way you see the change in a person you’ve been away from for a long time, where somebody</p>
      <p>who sees him every day, day in, day out, wouldn’t notice because the change is gradual. All up the</p>
      <p>coast  I  could  see  the  signs  of  what  the  Combine  had  accomplished  since  I  was  last  through  this</p>
      <p>country, things like, for example—a train stopping at a station and laying a string of full-grown men</p>
      <p>in  mirrored  suits  and  machined  hats,  laying  them  like  a  hatch  of  identical  insects,  half-life  things</p>
      <p>coming pht-pht-pht out  of the  last  car,  then  hooting  its  electric  whistle  and moving  on  down  the</p>
      <p>spoiled land to deposit another hatch.</p>
      <p>Or  things  like  five  thousand  houses  punched  out  identical  by  a  machine  and  strung  across  the</p>
      <p>hills outside of town, so fresh from the factory they’re still linked together like sausages, a sign saying</p>
      <p>“NEST  IN  THE  WEST  HOMES—NO  DWN. PAYMENT  [204]  FOR  VETS,”  a  playground  down  the hill</p>
      <p>from the houses, behind a checker-wire fence and another sign that read “ST. LUKE’S SCHOOL FOR</p>
      <p>BOYS”—there  were  five  thousand  kids  in  green  corduroy  pants  and  white  shirts  under  green</p>
      <p>pullover  sweaters  playing  crack-the-whip  across  an  acre  of  crushed  gravel.  The  line  popped  and</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>134</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>twisted and jerked like a snake, and every crack popped a little kid off the end, sent him rolling up</p>
      <p>against  the  fence  like  a  tumbleweed.  Every  crack.  And  it  was  always  the  same  little  kid,  over  and</p>
      <p>over.</p>
      <p>All that five thousand kids lived in those five thousand houses, owned by those guys that got off</p>
      <p>the train. The houses looked so much alike that, time and time again, the kids went home by mistake</p>
      <p>to different houses and different families. Nobody ever noticed. They ate and went to bed. The only</p>
      <p>one they noticed was the little kid at the end of the whip. He’d always be so scuffed and bruised that</p>
      <p>he’d show up out of place wherever he went. He wasn’t able to open up and laugh either. It’s a hard</p>
      <p>thing to laugh if you can feel the pressure of those beams coming from every new car that passes, or</p>
      <p>every new house you pass.</p>
      <p>“We  can  even  have  a  lobby  in  Washington,”  Harding  was  saying,  “an  organization  NAAIP.</p>
      <p>Pressure  groups.  Big  billboards  along  the  highway  showing  a  babbling  schizophrenic  running  a</p>
      <p>wrecking machine, bold, red and green type: ‘Hire the Insane.’ We’ve got a rosy future, gentlemen.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>We crossed a bridge over the Siuslaw. There was just enough mist in the air that I could lick out</p>
      <p>my tongue to the wind and taste the ocean before we could see it. Everyone knew we were getting</p>
      <p>close and didn’t speak all the way to the docks.</p>
      <p>The captain who was supposed to take us out had a bald gray metal head set in a black turtleneck</p>
      <p>like a gun turret on a U-boat; the cold cigar sticking from his mouth swept over us. He stood beside</p>
      <p>McMurphy on the wooden pier and looked out to sea as he talked. Behind him and up a bunch of</p>
      <p>steps, six or eight men in windbreakers were sitting on a bench along the front of the bait shop. The</p>
      <p>captain talked loudly, half to the loafers on his one side and half to McMurphy on the other side,</p>
      <p>firing his copper-jacket voice someplace in between.</p>
      <p>“Don’t care. Told you specifically in the letter. You don’t have a signed waiver clearing me with</p>
      <p>proper authorities, I don’t go out.” The round head swiveled in the turret of his sweater, beading</p>
      <p>down that cigar at the lot of us. “Look there. Bunch like that at sea, could go to diving overboard</p>
      <p>[205] like rats. Relatives could sue me for everything I own. I can’t risk it.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy explained how the other girl was supposed to get all those papers up in Portland. One</p>
      <p>of the guys leaning against the bait shop called, “What other girl? Couldn’t Blondie there handle the</p>
      <p>lot of you?” McMurphy didn’t pay the guy any mind and went on arguing with the captain, but you</p>
      <p>could see how it bothered the girl. Those men against the shop kept leering at her and leaning close</p>
      <p>together to whisper things. All our crew, even the doctor, saw this and got to feeling ashamed that</p>
      <p>we didn’t do something. We weren’t the cocky bunch that was back at the service station.</p>
      <p>McMurphy stopped arguing when he saw he wasn’t getting any place with the captain, and turned</p>
      <p>around a couple of times, running his hand through his hair.</p>
      <p>“Which boat have we got rented?”</p>
      <p>“That’s it there. The Lark. Not a man sets foot on her till I have a signed waiver clearing me. Not</p>
      <p>a man.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t intend to rent a boat so we can sit all day and watch it bob up and down at the dock,”</p>
      <p>McMurphy said. “Don’t you have a phone up there in your bait shack? Let’s go get this cleared up.”</p>
      <p>They thumped up the steps onto the level with the bait shop and went inside, leaving us clustered</p>
      <p>up  by  ourselves,  with  that  bunch  of  loafers  up  there  watching  us  and  making  comments  and</p>
      <p>sniggering and goosing one another in the ribs. The wind was blowing the boats at their moorings,</p>
      <p>nuzzling them up against the wet rubber tires along the dock so they made a sound like they were</p>
      <p>laughing at us. The water was giggling under the boards, and the sign hanging over the door to the</p>
      <p>bait shack that read “SEAMAN’S SERVICE—CAPT BLOCK, PROP”</p>
      <p>was squeaking and scratching as the wind rocked it on rusty hooks. The mussels that clung to the</p>
      <p>pilings, four feet out of water marking the tide line, whistled and clicked in the sun.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>135</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>The wind had turned cold and mean, and Billy Bibbit took off his green coat and gave it to the</p>
      <p>girl, and she put it on over her thin little T-shirt. One of the loafers kept calling down, “Hey you,</p>
      <p>Blondie,  you  like  fruitcake  kids  like  that?”  The  man’s  lips  were  kidney-colored  and  he  was  purple</p>
      <p>under his eyes where the wind’d mashed the veins to the surface. “Hey you, Blondie,” he called over</p>
      <p>and over in a high, tired voice, “hey you, Blondie … hey you, Blondie ... hey you, Blondie …”</p>
      <p>We bunched up closer together against the wind.</p>
      <p>“Tell me, Blondie, what’ve they got you committed for?”</p>
      <p>[206] “Ahr, she ain’t committed, Perce, she’s part of the cure!”</p>
      <p>“Is that right, Blondie? You hired as part of the cure? Hey you, Blondie.”</p>
      <p>She lifted her head and gave us a look that asked where was that hard-boiled bunch she’d seen</p>
      <p>and  why  weren’t  they  saying  something  to  defend  her?  Nobody  would  answer  the  look.  All  our</p>
      <p>hard-boiled strength had just walked up those steps with his arm around the shoulders of that bald-</p>
      <p>headed captain.</p>
      <p>She pulled the collar of the jacket high around her neck and hugged her elbows and strolled as far</p>
      <p>away from us down the dock as she could go. Nobody went after her. Billy Bibbit shivered in the</p>
      <p>cold and bit his lip. The guys at the bait shack whispered something else and whooped out laughing</p>
      <p>again.</p>
      <p>“Ask ‘er, Perce—go on.”</p>
      <p>“Hey, Blondie, did you  get ‘am to sign  a waiver clearing you with proper authorities? Relatives</p>
      <p>could sue, they tell me, if one of the boys fell in and drown while he was on board. Did you ever</p>
      <p>think of that? Maybe you’d better stay here with us, Blondie.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, Blondie; my relatives wouldn’t sue. I promise. Stay here with us fellows, Blondie.”</p>
      <p>I imagined I could feel my feet getting wet as the dock sank with shame into the bay. We weren’t</p>
      <p>fit to be out here with people. I wished McMurphy would come back out and cuss these guys good</p>
      <p>and then drive us back where we belonged.</p>
      <p>The man with the kidney lips folded his knife and stood up and brushed the whittle shavings out</p>
      <p>of his lap. He started walking toward the steps. “C’mon now, Blondie, what you want to mess with</p>
      <p>these bozos for?”</p>
      <p>She turned and looked at him from the end of the dock, then back at us, and you could tell she</p>
      <p>was  thinking  his  proposition  over  when  the  door  of  the  bait  shop  opened  and  McMurphy  came</p>
      <p>shoving out past the bunch of them, down the steps.</p>
      <p>“Pile in, crew, it’s all set! Gassed and ready and there’s bait and beer on board.”</p>
      <p>He slapped Billy on the rear and did a little hornpipe and commenced slinging ropes from their</p>
      <p>snubs.</p>
      <p>“Ol’ Cap’n Block’s still on the phone, but we’ll be pulling off as quick as he comes out. George,</p>
      <p>let’s  see  if  you  can  get  that  motor  warmed  up.  Scanlon,  you  and  Harding  untie  that  rope  there.</p>
      <p>Candy! What you doing off down there? Let’s get with it, honey, we’re shoving off.”</p>
      <p>We swarmed into the boat, glad for anything that would take us away from those guys standing in</p>
      <p>a  row  at  the  bait  shop.  [207]  Billy  took  the  girl  by  the  hand  and  helped  her  on  board.  George</p>
      <p>hummed over the dashboard up on the bridge, pointing out buttons for McMurphy to twist or push.</p>
      <p>“Yeah,  these pukers,  puke  boats,  we  call  them,”  he  said  to  McMurphy,  “they  joost  as  easy  like</p>
      <p>driving the ottomobile.”</p>
      <p>The doctor hesitated before climbing aboard and looked toward the shop where all the loafers</p>
      <p>stood milling toward the steps.</p>
      <p>“Don’t you think, Randle, we’d better wait ... until the captain—”</p>
      <p>McMurphy caught him by the lapels and lifted him clear of the dock into the boat like he was a</p>
      <p>small boy. “Yeah, Doc,” he said, “wait till the captain what?” He commenced to laugh like he was</p>
      <p>drunk, talking in an excited, nervous way. “Wait till the captain comes out and tells us that the phone</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>136</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>number I gave him is a flophouse up in Portland? You bet. Here, George, damn your eyes; take hold</p>
      <p>of this thing and get us out of here! Sefelt! Get that rope loose and get on. George, come on.”</p>
      <p>The motor chugged and died, chugged again like it was clearing its throat, then roared full on.</p>
      <p>“Hoowee! There she goes. Pour the coal to ‘er, George, and all hands stand by to repel boarders!”</p>
      <p>A white gorge of smoke and water roared from the back of the boat, and the door of the bait</p>
      <p>shop crashed open and the captain’s head came booming out and down the steps like it was not only</p>
      <p>dragging his body behind it but the bodies of the eight other guys as well. They came thundering</p>
      <p>down the dock and stopped right at the boil of foam washing over their feet as George swung the</p>
      <p>big boat out and away from the docks and we had the sea to ourselves.</p>
      <p>A  sudden  turn  of  the  boat  had  thrown  Candy  to  her  knees,  and  Billy  was  helping  her  up  and</p>
      <p>trying  to  apologize  for  the  way  he’d  acted  on  the dock  at  the  same  time.  McMurphy  came  down</p>
      <p>from the bridge  and  asked  if  the  two  of  them  would  like  to  be  alone  so  they  could  talk  over  old</p>
      <p>times, and Candy looked at Billy and all he could do was shake his head and stutter. McMurphy said</p>
      <p>in that case that he and Candy’d better go below and check for leaks and the rest of us could make</p>
      <p>do  for  a  while.  He  stood  at  the  door  down  to  the  cabin  and  saluted  and  winked  and  appointed</p>
      <p>George captain and Harding second in command and said, “Carry on, mates,” and followed the girl</p>
      <p>out of sight into the cabin.</p>
      <p>The wind lay down and the sun got higher, chrome-plating the east side of the deep green swells.</p>
      <p>George aimed the boat [208] straight out to sea, full throttle, putting the docks and that bait shop</p>
      <p>farther and farther behind us. When we passed the last point of the jetty and the last black rock, I</p>
      <p>could feel a great calmness creep over me, a calmness that increased the farther we left land behind</p>
      <p>us.</p>
      <p>The guys had talked excitedly for a few minutes about our piracy of the boat, but now they were</p>
      <p>quiet. The cabin door opened once long enough for a hand to shove out a case of beer, and Billy</p>
      <p>opened us each one with an opener he found in the tackle box, and passed them around. We drank</p>
      <p>and watched the land sinking in our wake.</p>
      <p>A mile or so out George cut the speed to what he called a trolling idle, put four guys to the four</p>
      <p>poles in the back of the boat, and the rest of us sprawled in the sun on top of the cabin or up on the</p>
      <p>bow and took off our shirts and watched the guys trying to rig their poles. Harding said the rule was</p>
      <p>a guy got to hold a pole till he got one strike, then he had to change off with a man who hadn’t had</p>
      <p>a chance. George stood at the wheel, squinting out through the salt-caked windshield, and hollered</p>
      <p>instructions back how to fix up the reels and lines and how to tie a herring into the herring harness</p>
      <p>and how far back to fish and how deep:</p>
      <p>“And  take  that  number  four  pole  and  you  put  you  twelve  ounces  on  him  on  a  rope  with  a</p>
      <p>breakaway  rig—I  show  you  how  in  joost  a  minute—and  we  go  after  that  big  fella  down  on  the</p>
      <p>bottom with that pole, by golly!”</p>
      <p>Martini ran to the edge and leaned over the side and stared down into the water in the direction</p>
      <p>of his line. “Oh. Oh, my God,” he said, but whatever he saw was too deep down for the rest of us.</p>
      <p>There  were  other  sports  boats  trolling  up  and  down  the  coast,  but  George  didn’t  make  any</p>
      <p>attempt to join them; he kept pushing steadily straight on out past them, toward the open sea. “You</p>
      <p>bet,” he said. “We go out with the commercial boats, where the real fish is.”</p>
      <p>The swells slid by, deep emerald on one side, chrome on the other. The only noise was the engine</p>
      <p>sputtering and humming, off and on, as the swells dipped the exhaust in and out of the water, and</p>
      <p>the funny, lost cry of the raggedy little black birds swimming around asking one another directions.</p>
      <p>Everything  else  was  quiet.  Some  of  the  guys  slept,  and  the  others  watched  the  water.  We’d  been</p>
      <p>trolling close to an hour when the tip of Sefelt’s pole arched and dived into the water.</p>
      <p>“George! Jesus, George, give us a hand!”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>137</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>George wouldn’t have a thing to do with the pole; he grinned [209] and told Sefelt to ease up on</p>
      <p>the star drag, keep the tip pointed up, up, and work hell outa that fella!</p>
      <p>“But what if I have a seizure?” Sefelt hollered.</p>
      <p>“Why, we’ll simply put hook and line on you and use you for a lure,” Harding said. “Now work</p>
      <p>that fella, as the captain ordered, and quit worrying about a seizure.”</p>
      <p>Thirty yards back of the boat the fish broke into the sun in a shower of silver scales, and Sefelt’s</p>
      <p>eyes popped and be got go excited watching the fish he let the end of his pole go down, and the line</p>
      <p>snapped into the boat like a rubber band.</p>
      <p>“Up, I told you! You let him get a straight pull, don’t you see? Keep that tip up ... up! You had you</p>
      <p>one big silver there, by golly.”</p>
      <p>Sefelt’s jaw was white and shaking when he finally gave up the pole to Fredrickson. “Okay—but</p>
      <p>if you get a fish with a hook in his mouth, that’s my godblessed fish!”</p>
      <p>I was as excited as the rest. I hadn’t planned on fishing, but after seeing that steel power a salmon</p>
      <p>has at the end of a line I got off the cabin top and put on my shirt to wait my turn at a pole.</p>
      <p>Scanlon got up a pool for the biggest fish and another for the first fish landed, four bits  from</p>
      <p>everybody that wanted in it, and he’d no more’n got his money in his pocket than Billy drug in some</p>
      <p>awful thing that looked like a ten-pound toad with spines on it like a porcupine.</p>
      <p>“That’s no fish,” Scanlon said. “You can’t win on that.”</p>
      <p>“It isn’t a b-b-bird.”</p>
      <p>“That there, he’s a ling cod,” George told us. “He’s one good eating fish you get all his warts off.”</p>
      <p>“See there. He is too a fish. P-p-pay up.”</p>
      <p>Billy gave me his pole and took his money and went to sit up close to the cabin where McMurphy</p>
      <p>and the girl were, looking at the closed door forlornly. “I wu-wu-wu-wish we had enough poles to</p>
      <p>go around,” he said, leaning back against the side of the cabin.</p>
      <p>I sat down and held the pole and watched the line swoop out into the wake. I smelt the air and</p>
      <p>felt the four cans of beer I’d drunk shorting out dozens of control leads down inside me: all around,</p>
      <p>the chrome sides of the swells flickered and flashed in the sun.</p>
      <p>George sang out for us to look up ahead, that here come just what we been looking for. I leaned</p>
      <p>around  to  look,  but  all  I  saw  was  a  big  drifting  log  and  those  black  seagulls  circling  and  diving</p>
      <p>around the log, like black leaves caught up in a dust devil. George speeded up some, heading into</p>
      <p>the place where [210] the birds circled, and the speed of the boat dragged my line until I couldn’t see</p>
      <p>how you’d be able to tell if you did get a bite.</p>
      <p>“Those  fellas,  those  cormorants,  they  go  after  a  school  of  candle  fishes,”  George  told  us  as  he</p>
      <p>drove. “Little white fishes the size of your finger. You dry them and they burn joost like a candle.</p>
      <p>They are food fish, chum fish. And you bet where there’s a big school of them candle fish you find</p>
      <p>the silver salmon feeding.”</p>
      <p>He drove into the birds, missing the floating log, and suddenly all around me the smooth slopes</p>
      <p>of chrome were shattered by diving birds and churning minnows, and the sleek silver-blue torpedo</p>
      <p>backs of the salmon slicing through it all. I saw one of the backs check its direction and turn and set</p>
      <p>course for a spot thirty yards behind the end of my pole, where my herring would be. I braced, my</p>
      <p>heart ringing, and then felt a jolt up both arms as if somebody’d hit the pole with a ball bat, and my</p>
      <p>line  went  burning  off  the  reel  from  under  my  thumb,  red  as  blood.  “Use  the  star  drag!”  George</p>
      <p>yelled at me, but what I knew about star drags you could put in your eye so I just mashed harder</p>
      <p>with my thumb until the line turned back to yellow, then slowed and stopped. I looked around, and</p>
      <p>there  were  all  three  of  the  other  poles  whipping  around  just  like  mine,  and  the  rest  of  the  guys</p>
      <p>scrambling  down  off  the  cabin  at  the  excitement  and  doing  everything  in  their  power  to  get</p>
      <p>underfoot.</p>
      <p>“Up! Up! Keep the tip up!” George was yelling.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>138</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“McMurphy! Get out here and look at this.”</p>
      <p>“Godbless you, Fred, you got my blessed fish!”</p>
      <p>“McMurphy, we need some help!”</p>
      <p>I heard McMurphy laughing and saw him out of the corner of my eye, just standing at the cabin</p>
      <p>door, not even making a move to do anything, and I was too busy cranking at my fish to ask him for</p>
      <p>help. Everyone was shouting at him to do something, but he wasn’t moving. Even the doctor, who</p>
      <p>had the deep pole, was asking McMurphy for assistance. And McMurphy was just laughing. Harding</p>
      <p>finally saw McMurphy wasn’t going to do anything, so he got the gaff and jerked my fish into the</p>
      <p>boat  with  a  clean,  graceful  motion  like  he’s  been  boating  fish  all  his  life.  He’s  big  as  my  leg,  I</p>
      <p>thought, big as a fence post! I thought, He’s bigger’n any fish we ever got at the falls. He’s springing</p>
      <p>all over the bottom of the boat like a rainbow gone wild! Smearing blood and scattering scales like</p>
      <p>little silver dimes, and I’m scared he’s gonna flop overboard. McMurphy won’t make a move to help.</p>
      <p>Scanlon grabs the fish and [211]  wrestles it down to keep it from flopping over the side. The girl</p>
      <p>comes running up from below, yelling it’s her turn, dang it, grabs my pole, and jerks the hook into</p>
      <p>me three times while I’m trying to tie on a herring for her.</p>
      <p>“Chief,  I’ll  be  damned  if  I  ever  saw  anything  so  slow!  Ugh,  your  thumb’s  bleeding.  Did  that</p>
      <p>monster bite you? Somebody fix the Chief’s thumb—hurry!”</p>
      <p>“Here we go into them again,” George yells, and I drop the line off the back of the boat and see</p>
      <p>the flash of the herring vanish in the dark blue-gray charge of a salmon and the line go sizzling down</p>
      <p>into the water. The girl wraps both arms around the pole and grits her teeth. “Oh no you don’t, dang</p>
      <p>you! Oh no ...!”</p>
      <p>She’s on her feet, got the butt of the pole scissored in her crotch and both arms wrapped below</p>
      <p>the reel and the reel crank knocking against her as the line spins out: “Oh no you don’t!” She’s still</p>
      <p>got on Billy’s green jacket, but that reel’s whipped it. She’s and everybody on board sees the T-shirt</p>
      <p>she had on is gone—everybody gawking, trying to play his own fish, dodge mine slamming around</p>
      <p>the boat bottom, with the crank of that reel fluttering her breast at such a speed the nipple’s just red</p>
      <p>blur!</p>
      <p>Billy jumps to help. All he can think to do is reach around from behind and help her squeeze the</p>
      <p>pole tighter in between her breasts until the reel’s finally stopped by nothing more than the pressure</p>
      <p>of her flesh. By this time she’s flexed so taut and her breasts look so firm I think she and Billy could</p>
      <p>both turn loose with their hands and arms and she’d still keep hold of that pole.</p>
      <p>This scramble of action holds for a space, a second there on the sea—the men yammering and</p>
      <p>struggling and cussing and trying to tend their poles while watching the girl; the bleeding, crashing</p>
      <p>battle  between  Scanlon  and  my  fish  at  everybody’s  feet;  the  lines  all  tangled  and  shooting  every</p>
      <p>which way with the doctor’s glasses-on-a-string tangled and dangling from one line ten feet off the</p>
      <p>back  of the  boat,  fish  striking  at  the  flash  of  the  lens,  and the  girl  cussing  for  all  she’s  worth  and</p>
      <p>looking  now  at  her  bare  breasts,  one  white  and  one  smarting  red—and  George  takes  his  eye  off</p>
      <p>where he’s going and runs the boat into that log and kills the engine.</p>
      <p>While McMurphy laughs. Rocking farther and farther backward against the cabin top, spreading</p>
      <p>his  laugh  out  across  the  water—laughing  at  the  girl,  at  the  guys,  at  George,  at  me  sucking  my</p>
      <p>bleeding thumb, at the captain back at the pier and the bicycle rider and the service-station guys and</p>
      <p>the five thousand [212] houses and the Big Nurse and all of it. Because he knows you have to laugh</p>
      <p>at the things that hurt you just to keep yourself in balance, just to keep the world from running you</p>
      <p>plumb crazy. He knows there’s a painful side; he knows my thumb smarts and his girl friend has a</p>
      <p>bruised breast and the doctor is losing his glasses, but he won’t let the pain blot out the humor no</p>
      <p>more’n he’ll let the humor blot out the pain.</p>
      <p>I  notice  Harding  is  collapsed  beside  McMurphy  and  is  laughing  too.  And  Scanlon  from  the</p>
      <p>bottom of the boat. At their own selves as well as at the rest of us. And the girl, with her eyes still</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>139</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>smarting as she looks from her white breast to her red one, she starts laughing. And Sefelt and the</p>
      <p>doctor, and all.</p>
      <p>It  started  slow  and  pumped  itself  full,  swelling  the  men  bigger  and  bigger.  I  watched,  part  of</p>
      <p>them, laughing with them—and somehow not with them. I was off the boat, blown up off the water</p>
      <p>and  skating  the  wind  with  those  black  birds,  high  above  myself,  and  I  could  look  down  and  see</p>
      <p>myself and the rest of the guys, see the boat rocking there in the middle of those diving birds, see</p>
      <p>McMurphy surrounded by his dozen people, and watch them, us, swinging a laughter that rang out</p>
      <p>on the water in ever-widening circles, farther and farther, until it crashed up on beaches all over the</p>
      <p>coast, on beaches all over all coasts, in wave after wave after wave.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>The  doctor  had  hooked  something  off  the  bottom  on  the  deep  pole,  and  everybody  else  on</p>
      <p>board except George had caught and landed a fish by the time he lifted it up to where we could even</p>
      <p>see it—just a whitish shape appearing, then diving for the bottom in spite of everything the doctor</p>
      <p>tried to do to hold it. As soon as he’d get it up near the top again, lifting and reeling at it with tight,</p>
      <p>stubborn little grunts and refusing any help the guys might offer, it would see the light and down it</p>
      <p>would go.</p>
      <p>George didn’t bother starting the boat again, but came down to show us how to clean the fish</p>
      <p>over the side and rip the gills out so the meat would stay sweeter. McMurphy tied a chunk of meat</p>
      <p>to  each  end  of  a  four-foot  string,  tossed  it  in the  air,  and  sent  two  squawking  birds  wheeling  off,</p>
      <p>“Till death do them part.”</p>
      <p>The whole back of the boat and most of the people in it were dappled with red and silver. Some</p>
      <p>of us took our shirts off and dipped them over the side and tried to clean them. We fiddled around</p>
      <p>this way, fishing a little, drinking the other case of beer, and feeding the birds till afternoon, while</p>
      <p>the boat rolled lazily around the swells and the doctor worked with his [213] monster from the deep.</p>
      <p>A wind came up and broke the sea into green and silver chunks, like a field of glass and chrome, and</p>
      <p>the boat began to rock and pitch about more. George told the doctor he’d have to land his fish or</p>
      <p>cut  it  loose  because  there  was  a  bad  sky  coming  down  on  us.  The  doctor  didn’t  answer.  He  just</p>
      <p>heaved harder on the pole, bent forward and reeled the slack, and heaved again.</p>
      <p>Billy and the girl had climbed around to the bow and were talking and looking down in the water.</p>
      <p>Billy hollered that he saw something, and we all rushed to that side, and a shape broad and white</p>
      <p>was becoming solid some ten or fifteen feet down. It was strange watching it rise, first just a light</p>
      <p>coloring, then a white form like fog under water, becoming solid, alive. ...</p>
      <p>“Jesus God,” Scanlon cried, “that’s the doc’s fish!”</p>
      <p>It was on the side opposite the doctor, but we could see by the direction of his line that it led to</p>
      <p>the shape under the water.</p>
      <p>“We’ll never get it in the boat,” Sefelt said. “And the wind’s getting stronger.”</p>
      <p>“He’s a big flounder,” George said. “Sometimes they weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift</p>
      <p>them in with the winch.”</p>
      <p>“We’ll  have  to  cut  him  loose,  Doc,”  Sefelt  said  and  put  his  arm  across  the  doctor’s  shoulders.</p>
      <p>The doctor didn’t say anything; he had sweated clear through his suit between his shoulders, and his</p>
      <p>eyes were bright red from going so long without glasses. He kept heaving until the fish appeared on</p>
      <p>his side of the boat. We watched it near the surface for a few minutes longer, then started getting the</p>
      <p>rope and gaff ready.</p>
      <p>Even with the gaff in it, it took another hour to drag the fish into the back of the boat. We had to</p>
      <p>hook him with all three other poles, and McMurphy leaned down and got a hand in his  gills,  and</p>
      <p>with a heave he slid in, transparent white and flat, and flopped down to the bottom of the boat with</p>
      <p>the doctor.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>140</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“That was something.” The doctor panted from the floor, not enough strength left to push the</p>
      <p>huge fish off him. “That was ... certainly something.”</p>
      <p>The boat pitched and cracked all the way back to shore, with McMurphy telling grim tales about</p>
      <p>shipwrecks and sharks. The waves got bigger as we got closer to shore, and from the crests clots of</p>
      <p>white foam blew swirling up in the wind to join the gulls. The swells at the mouth of the jetty were</p>
      <p>combing higher than the boat, and George had us all put on life jackets. I noticed all the other sports</p>
      <p>boats were in.</p>
      <p>We were three jackets short, and there was a fuss as to who’d [214] be the three that braved that</p>
      <p>bar without jackets. It finally turned out to be Billy Bibbit and Harding and George, who wouldn’t</p>
      <p>wear one anyway on account of the dirt. Everybody was kind of surprised that Billy had volunteered,</p>
      <p>took  his  life  jacket  off  right  away  when  we  found  we  were  short,  and  helped  the  girl  into  it,  but</p>
      <p>everybody was even more surprised that McMurphy hadn’t insisted that he be one of the heroes; all</p>
      <p>during the fuss he’d stood with his back against the cabin, bracing against the pitch of the boat, and</p>
      <p>watched the guys without saying a word. Just grinning and watching.</p>
      <p>We hit the bar and dropped into a canyon of water, the bow of the boat pointing up the hissing</p>
      <p>crest  of  the  wave  going  before  us,  and  the  rear  down  in  the  trough  in  the  shadow  of  the  wave</p>
      <p>looming behind us, and everybody in the back hanging on the rail and looking from the mountain</p>
      <p>that chased behind to the streaming black rocks of the jetty forty feet to the left, to George at the</p>
      <p>wheel. He stood there like a mast. He kept turning his head from the front to the back, gunning the</p>
      <p>throttle,  easing  off,  gunning  again,  holding  us  steady  riding  the  uphill  slant  of  that  wave  in  front.</p>
      <p>He’d told us before we started the run that if we went over that crest in front, we’d surfboard out of</p>
      <p>control  as  soon  as  the  prop  and  rudder  broke  water,  and  if  we  slowed  down  to  where  that  wave</p>
      <p>behind caught up it would break over the stern and dump ten tons of water into the boat. Nobody</p>
      <p>joked  or  said  anything  funny  about  the  way  he  kept  turning  his  head  back  and  forth  like  it  was</p>
      <p>mounted up there on a swivel.</p>
      <p>Inside the mooring the water calmed to a choppy surface again, and at our dock, by the bait shop,</p>
      <p>we  could  see  the  captain  waiting  with  two  cops  at the  water’s  edge.  All  the  loafers  were  gathered</p>
      <p>behind them. George headed at them full throttle, booming down on them till the captain went to</p>
      <p>waving and yelling and the cops headed up the steps with the loafers. Just before the prow of the</p>
      <p>boat  tore  out  the  whole  dock,  George  swung  the  wheel,  threw  the  prop  into  reverse,  and  with  a</p>
      <p>powerful roar snuggled the boat in against the rubber tires like he was easing it into bed. We were</p>
      <p>already  out  tying  up by  the time our  wake  caught  up;  it  pitched  all  the boats  around  and  slopped</p>
      <p>over the dock and whitecapped around the docks like we’d brought the sea home with us.</p>
      <p>The captain and the cops and the loafers came tromping back down the steps to us. The doctor</p>
      <p>carried the fight to them by first off telling the cops they didn’t have any jurisdiction over us, as we</p>
      <p>were a legal, government-sponsored expedition, and if there was anyone to take the matter up with it</p>
      <p>[215] would have to be a federal agency. Also, there might be some investigation into the number of</p>
      <p>life jackets that the boat held if the captain really planned to make trouble. Wasn’t there supposed to</p>
      <p>be a life jacket for every man on board, according to the law? When the captain didn’t say anything</p>
      <p>the cops took some names and left, mumbling and confused, and as soon as they were off the pier</p>
      <p>McMurphy and the captain went to arguing and shoving each other around. McMurphy was drunk</p>
      <p>enough he was still trying to rock with the roll of the boat and he slipped on the wet wood and fell</p>
      <p>in the ocean twice before he got his footing sufficient to hit the captain one up alongside of his bald</p>
      <p>head  and  settle  the  fuss.  Everybody  felt  better  that  that  was  out  of  the  way,  and  the  captain  and</p>
      <p>McMurphy both went to the bait shop to get more beer while the rest of us worked at hauling our</p>
      <p>fish  out  of  the  hold.  The  loafers  stood  on  that  upper  dock,  watching  and  smoking  pipes  they’d</p>
      <p>carved themselves. We were waiting for them to say something about the girl again, hoping for it, to</p>
      <p>tell the truth, but when one of them finally did say something it wasn’t about the girl but about our</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>141</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>fish being the biggest halibut he’d ever seen brought in on the Oregon coast. All the rest nodded</p>
      <p>that that was sure the truth. They came edging down to look it over. They asked George where he</p>
      <p>learned to dock a boat that way, and we found out George’d not just run fishing boats but he’d also</p>
      <p>been captain of a PT boat in the Pacific and got the Navy Cross. “Shoulda gone into public office,”</p>
      <p>one of the loafers said. “Too dirty,” George told him.</p>
      <p>They could sense the change that most of us were only suspecting; these weren’t the same bunch</p>
      <p>of  weak-knees  from  a  nuthouse  that  they’d  watched  take  their  insults  on  the  dock  this  morning.</p>
      <p>They didn’t exactly apologize to the girl for the things they’d said, but when they asked to see the</p>
      <p>fish she’d caught they were just as polite as pie. And when McMurphy and the captain came back</p>
      <p>out of the bait shop we all shared a beer together before we drove away.</p>
      <p>It was late when we got back to the hospital.</p>
      <p>The girl was sleeping against Billy’s chest, and when she raised up his arm’d gone dead holding</p>
      <p>her all that way in such an awkward position, and she rubbed it for him. He told her if he had any of</p>
      <p>his weekends free he’d ask her for a date, and she said she could come to visit in two weeks if he’d</p>
      <p>tell her what time, and Billy looked at McMurphy for an answer. McMurphy put his arms around</p>
      <p>both of their shoulders and said, “Let’s make it two o’clock on the nose.”</p>
      <p>“Saturday afternoon?” she asked.</p>
      <p>[216] He winked at Billy and squeezed the girl’s head in the crook of his arm. “No. Two o’clock</p>
      <p>Saturday night. Slip up and knock on that same window you was at this morning. I’ll talk the night</p>
      <p>aide into letting you in.”</p>
      <p>She giggled and nodded. “You damned McMurphy,” she said.</p>
      <p>Some of  the  Acutes  on the  ward  were  still  up,  standing  around  the  latrine  to  see  if  we’d  been</p>
      <p>drowned or not. They watched us march into the hall, blood-speckled, sunburned, stinking of beer</p>
      <p>and fish, toting our salmon like we were conquering heroes. The doctor asked if they’d like to come</p>
      <p>out and look at his halibut in the back of his car, and we all started back out except McMurphy. He</p>
      <p>said  he  guessed  he  was  pretty  shot  and  thought  he’d  hit  the  hay.  When  he  was  gone  one  of  the</p>
      <p>Acutes who hadn’t made the trip asked how come McMurphy looked so beat and worn out where</p>
      <p>the rest of us looked redcheeked and still full of excitement. Harding passed it off as nothing more</p>
      <p>than the loss of his suntan.</p>
      <p>“You’ll recall McMurphy came in full steam, from a rigorous life outdoors on a work farm, ruddy</p>
      <p>of face and abloom with physical health. We’ve simply been witness to the fading of his magnificent</p>
      <p>psychopathic suntan. That’s all. Today he did spend some exhausting hours—in the dimness of the</p>
      <p>boat cabin, incidentally—while we were out in the elements, soaking up the Vitamin D. Of course,</p>
      <p>that may have exhausted him to some extent, those rigors down below, but think of it, friends. As</p>
      <p>for myself, I believe I could have done with a little less Vitamin D and a little more of his kind of</p>
      <p>exhaustion. Especially with little Candy as a taskmaster. Am I wrong?”</p>
      <p>I  didn’t  say  so,  but  I  was  wondering  if  maybe  he  wasn’t  wrong.  I’d  noticed  McMurphy’s</p>
      <p>exhaustion earlier, on the trip home, after he’d insisted on driving past the place where he’d lived</p>
      <p>once. We’d just shared the last beer and slung the empty can out the window at a stop sign and were</p>
      <p>just leaning back to get the feel of the day, swimming in that kind of tasty drowsiness that comes</p>
      <p>over you after a day of going hard at something you enjoy doing—half sunburned and half drunk</p>
      <p>and  keeping  awake  only  because  you  wanted  to  savor  the  taste  as  long  as  you  could.  I  noticed</p>
      <p>vaguely that I was getting so’s I could see some good in the life around me. McMurphy was teaching</p>
      <p>me. I was feeling better than I’d remembered feeling since I was a kid, when everything was good</p>
      <p>and the land was still singing kids’ poetry to me.</p>
      <p>We’d drove back inland instead of the coast, to go through this town McMurphy’d lived in the</p>
      <p>most he’d ever lived in one [217] place. Down the face of the Cascade hill, thinking we were lost till</p>
      <p>… we came to a town covered a space about twice the size of the hospital ground. A gritty wind had</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>142</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>blown out the sun on the street where he stopped. He parked in some reeds and pointed across the</p>
      <p>road.</p>
      <p>“There.  That’s  the  one.  Looks  like  it’s  propped  up  outta  the  weeds—my  misspent  youth’s</p>
      <p>humble abode.”</p>
      <p>Out along the dim six-o’clock street, I saw leafless trees standing, striking the sidewalk there like</p>
      <p>wooden lightning, concrete split apart where they hit, all in a fenced-in ring. An iron line of pickets</p>
      <p>stuck out of the ground along the front of a tangleweed yard, and on back was a big frame house</p>
      <p>with  a  porch,  leaning  a  rickety  shoulder  hard  into  the  wind  so’s  not  to  be  sent  tumbling  away  a</p>
      <p>couple of blocks like an empty cardboard grocery box. The wind was blowing a few drops of rain,</p>
      <p>and I saw the house had its eyes clenched shut and locks at the door banged on a chain.</p>
      <p>And  on  the  porch,  hanging,  was  one  of  those  things  the  Japs  make  out  of  glass  and  hang  on</p>
      <p>strings—rings and clangs in the least little blow—with only four pieces of glass left to go. These four</p>
      <p>swung and whipped and rung little chips off on the wooden porch floor.</p>
      <p>McMurphy put the car back in gear.</p>
      <p>“Once, I been here—since way the hell gone back in the year we were all gettin’ home from that</p>
      <p>Korea mess. For a visit. My old man and old lady were still alive. It was a good home.”</p>
      <p>He let out the clutch and started to drive, then stopped instead.</p>
      <p>“My God,” he said, “look over there, see a dress?” He pointed out back. “In the branch of that</p>
      <p>tree? A rag, yellow and black?”</p>
      <p>I was able to see a thing like a flag, flapping high in the branches over a shed.</p>
      <p>“The  first  girl  ever  drug  me  to  bed  wore  that  very  same  dress.  I  was  about  ten  and  she  was</p>
      <p>probably less, and at the time a lay seemed like such a big deal I asked her if didn’t she think, feel, we</p>
      <p>oughta announce it some way? Like, say, tell our folks, ‘Mom, Judy and me got engaged today.’ And I</p>
      <p>meant what I said, I was that big a fool. I thought if you made it, man, you were legally wed, right</p>
      <p>there on the spot, whether it was something you wanted or not, and that there wasn’t any breaking</p>
      <p>the rule. But this little whore—at the most eight or nines—reached down and got her dress oft the</p>
      <p>floor and said it was mine, said, ‘You can hang this up someplace, I’ll go home [218] in my drawers,</p>
      <p>announce it that way-they’ll get the idea.’ Jesus, nine years old,” he said, reached over and pinched</p>
      <p>Candy’s nose, “and knew a lot more than a good many pros.”</p>
      <p>She bit his hand, laughing, and he studied the mark.</p>
      <p>“So, anyhow, after she went home in her pants I waited till dark when I had the chance to throw</p>
      <p>that  damned  dress  out  in  the  night—but  you  feel  that  wind?  Caught  the  dress  like  a  kite  and</p>
      <p>whipped it around the house outa sight and the next morning, by God, it was hung up in that tree</p>
      <p>for the whole town, was how I figured then, to turn out and see.”</p>
      <p>He sucked his hand, so woebegone that Candy laughed and gave it a kiss.</p>
      <p>“So  my  colors  were  flown,  and  from  that  day  to  this  it  seemed  I  might  as  well  live  up  to  my</p>
      <p>name—dedicated lover—and it’s the God’s truth: that little nine-year-old kid out of my youth’s the</p>
      <p>one who’s to blame.”</p>
      <p>The house drifted past. He yawned and winked. “Taught me to love, bless her sweet ass.”</p>
      <p>Then—as  he  was  talking—a  set  of  tail-lights  going  past  lit  up  McMurphy’s  face,  and  the</p>
      <p>windshield  reflected  an  expression  that  was  allowed  only  because  he  figured  it’d  be  too  dark  for</p>
      <p>anybody in the car to see, dreadfully tired and strained and frantic, like there wasn’t enough time left</p>
      <p>for something he had to do ...</p>
      <p>While his relaxed, good-natured voice doled out his life for us to live, a rollicking past full of kid</p>
      <p>fun and drinking buddies and loving women and barroom battles over meager honors—for all of us</p>
      <p>to dream ourselves into.</p>

      </p><p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>26</p>
      <p>The  Big  Nurse  had  her  next  maneuver  under  way  the  day  after  the  fishing  trip.  The  idea  had</p>
      <p>come to her  when  she  was  talking  to  McMurphy  the  day  before  about  how much  money he  was</p>
      <p>making off the fishing trip and other little enterprises along that line. She bad worked the idea over</p>
      <p>that night, looking at it from every direction this time until she was dead sure it could not fail, and all</p>
      <p>the next day she fed hints around to start a rumor and have it breeding good before she actually said</p>
      <p>anything about it.</p>
      <p>She  knew that  people, being  like  they  are,  sooner or  later  are  going to  draw  back  a  ways  from</p>
      <p>somebody who seems to be giving a little more than ordinary, from Santa Clauses and missionaries</p>
      <p>and men donating funds to worthy causes, and begin to wonder: What’s in it for them? Grin out of</p>
      <p>the  side  of  their  mouths  when  the  young  lawyer,  say,  brings  a  sack  of  pecans  to  the  kids  in  his</p>
      <p>district school—just before nominations for state senate, the sly devil—and say to one another, He’s</p>
      <p>nobody’s fool.</p>
      <p>She knew it wouldn’t take too much to get the guys to [220] wondering just what it was, now that</p>
      <p>you mention it, that made McMurphy spend so much time and energy organizing fishing trips to the</p>
      <p>coast and arranging Bingo parties and coaching basketball teams. What pushed him to keep up a full</p>
      <p>head  of  steam  when  everybody  else  on  the  ward  had  always  been  content  to  drift  along  playing</p>
      <p>pinochle and reading last year’s magazines? How come this one guy, this Irish rowdy from a work</p>
      <p>farm where he’d been serving time for gambling and battery, would loop a kerchief around his head,</p>
      <p>coo like a teenager, and spend two solid hours having every Acute on the ward hoorahing him while</p>
      <p>he played the girl trying to teach Billy Bibbit to dance? Or how come a seasoned con like this—an</p>
      <p>old pro, a carnival artist, a dedicated odds-watcher gambling man—would risk doubling his stay in</p>
      <p>the nuthouse  by  making  more  and  more  an  enemy  out of  the  woman  who  had the  say—so  as  to</p>
      <p>who got discharged and who didn’t?</p>
      <p>The nurse got the wondering started by pasting up a statement of the patients’ financial doings</p>
      <p>over the last few months; it must have taken her hours of work digging into records. It showed a</p>
      <p>steady  drain  out  of  the  funds  of  all  the  Acutes,  except one.  His  funds  had  risen  since  the  day  he</p>
      <p>came in.</p>
      <p>The Acutes took to joking with McMurphy about bow it looked like he was taking them down</p>
      <p>the line, and he was never one to deny it. Not the least bit. In fact, he bragged that if he stayed on at</p>
      <p>this hospital a year or so he just might be discharged out of it into financial independence, retire to</p>
      <p>Florida for the rest of his life. They all laughed about that when he was around, but when be was off</p>
      <p>the  ward  at  ET  or  OT  or  PT,  or  when  he  was  in  the  Nurses’  Station  getting  bawled  out  about</p>
      <p>something, matching her fixed plastic smile with his big ornery grin, they weren’t exactly laughing.</p>
      <p>They  began  asking  one  another  why  he’d  been  such  a  busy  bee  lately,  hustling  things  for  the</p>
      <p>patients  like  getting  the rule  lifted  that  the  men  had  to  be  together  in  therapeutic  groups  of  eight</p>
      <p>whenever they went somewhere (“Billy here has been talkin’ about slicin’ his wrists again,” he said in</p>
      <p>a meeting when he was arguing against the group-of-eight rule. “So is there seven of you guys who’d</p>
      <p>like  to  join him  and  make  it therapeutic?”),  and  like  the  way he maneuvered  the  doctor,  who  was</p>
      <p>much closer to the patients since the fishing trip, into ordering subscriptions to Playboy and Nugget</p>
      <p>and Man and getting rid of all the old McCall’s that bloated-face Public Relation had been bringing</p>
      <p>from home and leaving in a pile on the ward, articles he thought we might be particularly interested</p>
      <p>in checked with a green-ink pen. McMurphy even had a petition [221] in the mail to somebody back</p>
      <p>in Washington, asking that they look into the lobotomies and electro-shock that were still going on</p>
      <p>in government hospitals. I just wonder, the guys were beginning to ask, what’s in it for ol’ Mack?</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>145</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>After the thought had been going around he ward a week or so, the Big Nurse tried to make her</p>
      <p>play in group meeting; the first time she tried, McMurphy was there at the meeting and he beat her</p>
      <p>before she got good and started (she started by telling the group that she was shocked and dismayed</p>
      <p>by the pathetic state the ward had allowed itself to fall into: Look around, for heaven sakes; actual</p>
      <p>pornography  clipped  from  those  smut  books  and  pinned  on  the  walls—she  was  planning,</p>
      <p>incidentally,  to  see  to  it  that  the  Main  Building  made  an  investigation  of  the  dirt  that  had  been</p>
      <p>brought into this hospital. She sat back in her chair, getting ready to go on and point out who was to</p>
      <p>blame  and  why,  sitting  on that  couple  seconds  of  silence  that  followed her  threat  like  sitting  on  a</p>
      <p>throne, when McMurphy broke her spell into whoops of laughter by telling her to be sure, now, an’</p>
      <p>remind the Main Building to bring their leetle hand mirrors when they came for the investigation)—</p>
      <p>so the next time she made her play she made sure he wasn’t at the meeting.</p>
      <p>He had a long-distance phone call from Portland and was down in the phone lobby with one of</p>
      <p>the black boys, waiting for the party to call again. When one o’clock came around and we went to</p>
      <p>moving things, getting the day room ready, the least black boy asked if she wanted him to go down</p>
      <p>and get McMurphy and Washington for the meeting, but she said no, it was all right, let him stay—</p>
      <p>besides, some of the men here might like a chance to discuss our Mr. Randle Patrick McMurphy in</p>
      <p>the absence of his dominating presence.</p>
      <p>They  started the meeting  telling  funny  stories  about  him  and  what  he’d  done,  and  talked  for  a</p>
      <p>while about what a great guy he was, and she kept still, waiting till they all talked this out of their</p>
      <p>systems. Then the other questions started coming up. What about McMurphy? What made him go</p>
      <p>on like he was, do the things he did? Some of the guys wondered if maybe that tale of him faking</p>
      <p>fights  at  the  work  farm  to  get  sent here  wasn’t  just  more of his  spoofing,  and that  maybe he  was</p>
      <p>crazier than people thought. The Big Nurse smiled at this and raised her hand.</p>
      <p>“Crazy like a fox,” she said. “I believe that is what you’re trying to say about Mr. McMurphy.”</p>
      <p>“What  do  you  m-m-mean?”  Billy  asked.  McMurphy  was  his  special  friend  and  hero,  and  he</p>
      <p>wasn’t too sure he was pleased [222] with the way she’d laced that compliment with things she didn’t</p>
      <p>say out loud. “What do you m-m-mean, ‘like a fox’?”</p>
      <p>“It’s a simple observation, Billy,” the nurse answered pleasantly. “Let’s see if some of the other</p>
      <p>men could tell you what it means. What about you, Mr. Scanlon?”</p>
      <p>“She means, Billy, that Mack’s nobody’s fool.”</p>
      <p>“Nobody said he wuh-wuh-wuh-was!” Billy hit the arm of the chair with his fist to get out the last</p>
      <p>word. “But Miss Ratched was im-implying—”</p>
      <p>“No, Billy, I wasn’t implying anything. I was simply observing that Mr. McMurphy isn’t one to</p>
      <p>run  a  risk  without  a reason.  You  would  agree to  that,  wouldn’t  you?  Wouldn’t  all  of  you  agree to</p>
      <p>that?”</p>
      <p>Nobody said anything.</p>
      <p>“And yet,” she went on, “he seems to do things without thinking of himself at all, as if he were a</p>
      <p>martyr or a saint. Would anyone venture that Mr. McMurphy was a saint?”</p>
      <p>She knew she was safe to smile around the room, waiting for an answer.</p>
      <p>“No, not a saint or a martyr. Here. Shall we examine a cross-section of this man’s philanthropy?”</p>
      <p>She took a sheet of yellow paper out of her basket. “Look at some of these gifts, as devoted fans of</p>
      <p>his might call them. First, there was the gift of the tub room. Was that actually his to give? Did he</p>
      <p>lose anything by acquiring it as a gambling casino? On the other hand, how much do you suppose he</p>
      <p>made in the short time he was croupier of his little Monte Carlo here on the ward? How much did</p>
      <p>you lose, Bruce? Mr. Sefelt? Mr. Scanlon? I think you all have some idea what your personal losses</p>
      <p>were,  but  do  you  know  what  his  total  winnings  came  to,  according  to  deposits  he  has  made  at</p>
      <p>Funds? Almost three hundred dollars.”</p>
      <p>Scanlon gave a low whistle, but no one else said anything.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>146</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“I have various other bets he made listed here, if any of you care to look, including something to</p>
      <p>do  with  deliberately  trying  to  upset  the  staff.  And  all  of  this  gambling  was,  is,  completely  against</p>
      <p>ward policy and every one of you who dealt with him knew it.”</p>
      <p>She looked at the paper again, then put it back in the basket.</p>
      <p>“And this recent fishing trip? What do you suppose Mr. McMurphy’s profit was on this venture?</p>
      <p>As  I  see  it,  he  was  provided  with  a  car  of  the  doctor’s,  even  with  money  from  the  doctor  for</p>
      <p>gasoline, and, I am told, quite a few other benefits—without having paid a nickel. Quite like a fox, I</p>
      <p>must say.”</p>
      <p>She held up her hand to stop Billy from interrupting.</p>
      <p>“Please, Billy, understand me: I’m not criticizing this sort [223] of activity as such; I just thought</p>
      <p>it would be better if we didn’t have any delusions about the man’s motives. But, at any rate, perhaps</p>
      <p>it  isn’t  fair  to  make  these  accusations  without  the  presence  of  the  man  we  are  speaking  of.  Let’s</p>
      <p>return to  the  problem  we  were  discussing  yesterday—what  was  it?”  She  went  leafing  through  her</p>
      <p>basket. “What was it, do you remember, Doctor Spivey?”</p>
      <p>The doctor’s head jerked up. “No ... wait ... I think …”</p>
      <p>She  pulled  a  paper  from  a  folder.  “Here  it  is.  Mr. Scanlon;  his  feelings  about  explosives.  Fine.</p>
      <p>We’ll go into that now, and at some other time when Mr. McMurphy is present we’ll return to him. I</p>
      <p>do think, however, that you might give what was said today some thought. Now, Mr. Scanlon …”</p>
      <p>Later that day there were eight or ten of us grouped together at the canteen door, waiting till the</p>
      <p>black boy was finished shoplifting hair oil, and some of the guys brought it up again. They said they</p>
      <p>didn’t agree with what the Big Nurse had been saying, but, hell, the old girl had some good points.</p>
      <p>And yet, damn it, Mack’s still a good guy … really.</p>
      <p>Harding finally brought the conversation into the open.</p>
      <p>“My friends, thou protest too much to believe the protesting. You are all believing deep inside</p>
      <p>your  stingy  little  hearts  that  our  Miss  Angel  of  Mercy  Ratched  is  absolutely  correct  in  every</p>
      <p>assumption she made today about McMurphy. You know she was,  and so do I. But why deny it?</p>
      <p>Let’s be honest and give this man his due instead of secretly criticizing his capitalistic talent. What’s</p>
      <p>wrong  with  him  making  a  little  profit?  We’ve  all  certainly  got  our  money’s  worth  every  time  he</p>
      <p>fleeced us, haven’t we? He’s a shrewd character with an eye out for a quick dollar. He doesn’t make</p>
      <p>any  pretense  about  his  motives,  does  he?  Why  should  we?  He  has  a  healthy  and  honest  attitude</p>
      <p>about  his  chicanery,  and  I’m  all  for  him,  just  as  I’m  for  the  dear  old  capitalistic  system  of  free</p>
      <p>individual enterprise, comrades, for him and his downright bullheaded gall  and the American flag,</p>
      <p>bless it, and the Lincoln Memorial and the whole bit. Remember the Maine, P. T. Barnum and the</p>
      <p>Fourth  of  July.  I  feel  compelled  to  defend  my  friend’s  honor  as  a  good  old  red,  white,  and  blue</p>
      <p>hundred-per-cent  American  con  man.  Good  guy,  my  foot.  McMurphy  would  be  embarrassed  to</p>
      <p>absolute tears if he were aware of some of the simon-pure motives people had been claiming were</p>
      <p>behind some of his dealings. He would take it as a direct effrontery to his craft.”</p>
      <p>He dipped into his pocket for his cigarettes; when he couldn’t find any he borrowed one from</p>
      <p>Fredrickson, lit it with a stagey sweep of his match, and went on.</p>
      <p>[224] “I’ll admit I was confused by his actions at first. That window-breaking—Lord, I thought,</p>
      <p>here’s a man that seems to actually want to stay in this hospital, stick with his buddies and all that</p>
      <p>sort  of  thing,  until  I  realized  that  McMurphy  was  doing  it  because  he  didn’t  want  to  lose  a  good</p>
      <p>thing. He’s making the most of his time in here. Don’t ever be misled by his back-woodsy ways; he’s</p>
      <p>a very sharp operator, level-headed as they come. You watch; everything he’s done was done with</p>
      <p>reason.”</p>
      <p>Billy wasn’t about to give in so easy. “Yeah. What about him teaching me to d-dance?” He was</p>
      <p>clenching his fists at his side; and on the backs of his hands I saw that the cigarette burns had all but</p>

      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>healed, and in their place were tattoos he’d drawn by licking an indelible pencil. “What about that,</p>
      <p>Harding? Where is he making muh-muh-money out of teaching me to dance?”</p>
      <p>“Don’t get upset, William,” Harding said. “But don’t get impatient, either. Let’s just sit easy and</p>
      <p>wait—and see how he works it.”</p>
      <p>It seemed like Billy and I were the only two left who believed in McMurphy. And that very night</p>
      <p>Billy swung over to Harding’s  way of  looking at things when McMurphy came back from making</p>
      <p>another phone call and told Billy that the date with Candy was on for certain and added, writing an</p>
      <p>address down for him, that it might be a good idea to send her a little bread for the trip.</p>
      <p>“Bread? Muh-money? How muh-muh-much?” He looked over to where Harding was grinning at</p>
      <p>him.</p>
      <p>“Oh, you know, man—maybe ten bucks for her and ten—”</p>
      <p>“Twenty bucks! It doesn’t cost that muh-muh-much for bus fare down here.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy looked up from under his hatbrim, gave Billy a slow grin, then rubbed his throat with</p>
      <p>his hand, running out a dusty tongue. “Boy, oh boy, but I’m terrible dry. Figure to be even drier by a</p>
      <p>week come Saturday. You wouldn’t begrudge her bringin’ me a little swallow, would you, Billy Boy?”</p>
      <p>And gave Billy such an innocent look Billy had to laugh and shake his head, no, and go off to a</p>
      <p>corner to excitedly talk over the next Saturday’s plans with the man he probably considered a pimp.</p>
      <p>I still had my own notions—how McMurphy was a giant come out of the sky to save us from the</p>
      <p>Combine  that  was  networking  the  land  with  copper  wire  and  crystal,  how  he  was  too  big  to  be</p>
      <p>bothered with something as measly as money—but even I came halfway to thinking like the others.</p>
      <p>What  happened  was  this:  He’d  helped  carry the  tables  into  the  tub room [225]  before one of  the</p>
      <p>group meetings and was looking at me standing beside the control panel.</p>
      <p>“By God, Chief,” he said, “it appears to me you grooved ten inches since that fishing trip. And</p>
      <p>lordamighty, look at the size of that foot of yours; big as a flatcar!”</p>
      <p>I looked down and saw how my foot was bigger than I’d ever remembered it, like McMurphy’s</p>
      <p>just saying it had blowed it twice its size.</p>
      <p>“And that arm! That’s the arm of an ex-football-playing Indian if I ever saw one. You know what</p>
      <p>I think? I think you oughta give this here panel a leetle heft, just to test how you’re comin’.”</p>
      <p>I shook my head and told him no, but he said we’d made a deal and I was obligated to give it a</p>
      <p>try to see how his growth system was working. I didn’t see any way out of it so I went to the panel</p>
      <p>just to show him I couldn’t do it. I bent down and took it by the levers.</p>
      <p>“That’s the baby, Chief. Now just straighten up. Get those legs  under your butt, there ... yeah,</p>
      <p>yeah. Easy now … just straighten up. Hooeee! Now ease ‘er back to the deck.”</p>
      <p>I  thought  he’d  be real  disappointed, but  when  I  stepped back  he  was  all  grins  and  pointing  to</p>
      <p>where  the  panel  was  off  its  mooring  by  half  a  foot.  “Better  set  her  back  where  she  came  from,</p>
      <p>buddy, so nobody’ll know. Mustn’t let anybody know yet.”</p>
      <p>Then,  after  the  meeting,  loafing  around  the  pinochle  games,  he  worked  the  talk  around  to</p>
      <p>strength  and  gut-power  and  to  the  control  panel  in  the  tub  room.  I  thought  he  was  going  to  tell</p>
      <p>them how he’d helped me get my size back; that would prove he didn’t do everything for money.</p>
      <p>But he didn’t mention me. He talked until Harding asked him if he was ready to have another try</p>
      <p>at  lifting  it  and  he  said  no,  but  just  because  he  couldn’t  lift  it  was  no  sign  it  couldn’t  be  done.</p>
      <p>Scanlon said maybe it could be done with a crane, but no man could lift that thing by himself, and</p>
      <p>McMurphy nodded and said maybe so, maybe so, but you never can tell about such things.</p>
      <p>I watched the way he played them, got them to come around to him and say, No, by Jesus, not a</p>
      <p>man alive could lift it—finally even suggest the bet themselves. I watched how reluctant he looked</p>
      <p>to bet. He let the odds stack up, sucked them in deeper and deeper till he had five to one on a sure</p>
      <p>thing  from  every  man  of  them,  some  of  them  betting  up  to  twenty  dollars.  He never  said  a  thing</p>
      <p>about seeing me lift it already.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>148</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>All  night  I  hoped he  wouldn’t  go  through  with  it.  And  during  [226]  the  meeting  the next  day,</p>
      <p>when  the  nurse  said  all  the  men  who  participated  in  the  fishing  trip  would  have  to  take  special</p>
      <p>showers because they were suspected of vermin, I kept hoping she’d fix it somehow, make us take</p>
      <p>our showers right away or something—anything to keep me from having to lift it.</p>
      <p>But when the meeting was over he led me and the rest of the guys into the tub room before the</p>
      <p>black boys could lock it up, and had me take the panel by the levers and lift. I didn’t want to, but I</p>
      <p>couldn’t help it. I felt like I’d helped him cheat them out of their money. They were all friendly with</p>
      <p>him  as  they  paid  their  bets,  but  I  knew  how  they  were  feeling  inside,  how  something  had  been</p>
      <p>kicked out from under them. As soon as I got the panel back in place, I ran out of the tub room</p>
      <p>without even looking at McMurphy and went into the latrine. I wanted to be by myself. I caught a</p>
      <p>look at myself in the mirror. He’d done what he said; my arms were big again, big as they were back</p>
      <p>in high school, back at the village, and my chest and shoulders were broad and hard. I was standing</p>
      <p>there looking when he came in. He held out a five-dollar bill.</p>
      <p>“Here you go, Chief, chewin’-gum money.”</p>
      <p>I shook my head and started to walk out of the latrine. He caught me by the arm.</p>
      <p>“Chief, I just offered you a token of my appreciation. If you figure you got a bigger cut comin’—</p>
      <p>”</p>
      <p>“No! Keep your money, I won’t have it.”</p>
      <p>He stepped back and put his thumbs in his pockets and tipped his head up at me. He looked me</p>
      <p>over for a while.</p>
      <p>“Okay,” he said. “Now what’s the story? What’s everybody in this place giving me the cold nose</p>
      <p>about?”</p>
      <p>I didn’t answer him.</p>
      <p>“Didn’t I do what I said I would? Make you man-sized again? What’s wrong with me around here</p>
      <p>all of a sudden? You birds act like I’m a traitor to my country.”</p>
      <p>“You’re always … winning things!”</p>
      <p>“Winning things! You damned moose, what are you accusW me of? All I do is hold up my end of</p>
      <p>the deal. Now what’s so all-fired—”</p>
      <p>“We thought it wasn’t to be winning things …”</p>
      <p>I could feel my chin jerking up and down the way it does before I start crying, but I didn’t start</p>
      <p>crying. I stood there in front of him with my chin jerking. He opened his mouth to say something,</p>
      <p>and then stopped. He took his thumbs out of his pockets and reached up and grabbed the bridge of</p>
      <p>his nose between his thumb and finger, like you see people do whose glasses are too tight between</p>
      <p>the lenses, and he closed his eyes.</p>
      <p>[227] “Winning, for Christsakes,” he said with his eyes closed. ‘‘Hoo boy, winning.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>So I figure what happened in the shower room that afternoon was more my fault than anybody</p>
      <p>else’s.  And  that’s  why  the  only  way  I  could  make  any  kind  of  amends  was  by  doing  what  I  did,</p>
      <p>without thinking about being cagey or safe or what would happen to me—and not worrying about</p>
      <p>anything else for once but the thing that needed to be done and the doing of it.</p>
      <p>Just after we left the latrine the three black boys came around, gathering the bunch of us for our</p>
      <p>special shower. The least black boy, scrambling along the baseboard with a black, crooked hand cold</p>
      <p>as  a  crowbar,  prying  guys  loose  leaning  there,  said  it  was  what  the  Big  Nurse  called  a  cautionary</p>
      <p>cleansing.  In  view  of  the  company  we’d  had  on  our  trip  we  should  get  cleaned  before  we  spread</p>
      <p>anything through the rest of the hospital.</p>
      <p>We lined up nude against the tile, and here one black boy came, a black plastic tube in his hand,</p>
      <p>squirting a stinking salve thick and sticky as egg white. In the hair first, then turn around an’ bend</p>
      <p>over an’ spread your cheeks!</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>149</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>The guys complained and kidded and joked about it, trying not to look at one another or those</p>
      <p>floating  slate  masks  working  down  the  line  behind  the  tubes,  like  nightmare  faces  in  negative,</p>
      <p>sighting down soft, squeezy nightmare gunbarrels. They kidded the black boys by saying things like</p>
      <p>“He, Washington, what do you fellas do for fun the other sixteen hours?” “Hey, Williams, can you</p>
      <p>tell me what I had for breakfast?”</p>
      <p>Everybody  laughed.  The black  boys  clenched  their  jaws  and  didn’t  answer;  this  wasn’t  the  way</p>
      <p>things used to be before that damned redhead came around.</p>
      <p>When Fredrickson spread his cheeks there was such a sound I thought the least black boy’d be</p>
      <p>blown clear off his feet.</p>
      <p>“Hark!” Harding said, cupping his hand to his ear. “The lovely voice of an angel.”</p>
      <p>Everyone  was  roaring,  laughing  and  kidding  one  another,  until  the  black  boy  moved  on  and</p>
      <p>stopped in front of the next man, and the room was suddenly absolutely quiet. The next man was</p>
      <p>George.  And  in  that  one  second,  with  the  laughing  and  kidding  and  complaining  stopped,  with</p>
      <p>Fredrickson there next to George straightening up and turning around and a big black boy about to</p>
      <p>ask George to lean his head down for a squirt of that stinking salve—right at that time all of us had</p>
      <p>a good idea about everything that was going to happen, and why [228] it had to happen, and why</p>
      <p>we’d all been wrong about McMurphy.</p>
      <p>George never used soap when he showered. He wouldn’t even let somebody hand him a towel to</p>
      <p>dry  himself  with.  The  black  boys  on  the  evening  shift  who  supervised  the  usual  Tuesday  and</p>
      <p>Thursday evening showers had learned it was easier to leave it go like this, and they didn’t force him</p>
      <p>to do any different. That was the way it’d been for a long time. All the black boys knew it. But now</p>
      <p>everybody  knew—even  George,  leaning  backward,  shaking  his  head,  covering  himself  with  big</p>
      <p>oakleaf hands—that this black boy, with his nose busted and his insides soured and his two buddies</p>
      <p>standing behind him waiting to see what he would do, couldn’t afford to pass up the chance.</p>
      <p>“Ahhhh, bend you head down here, Geo’ge. …”</p>
      <p>The guys were already looking to where McMurphy stood a couple of men down the line.</p>
      <p>“Ahhhh, c’mon, Geo’ge. …”</p>
      <p>Martini and Sefelt were standing in the shower, not moving. The drain at their feet kept choking</p>
      <p>short little gulps of air and soapy water. George looked at the drain a second, as if it were speaking</p>
      <p>to him. He watched it gurgle and choke. He looked back at the tube in the black hand before him,</p>
      <p>slow mucus running out of the little hole at the top of the tube down over the pig-iron knuckles.</p>
      <p>The  black  boy  moved  the  tube  forward  a  few  inches,  and  George  listed  farther back,  shaking  his</p>
      <p>head.</p>
      <p>“No—none that stoof.”</p>
      <p>“You gonna have to do it, Rub-a-dub,” the black boy said, sounding almost sorry. “You gonna</p>
      <p>have to. We can’t have the place crawlin’ with bugs, now, can we? For all I know you got bugs on you</p>
      <p>a good inch deep!”</p>
      <p>“No!” George said.</p>
      <p>‘Ahhh,  Geo’ge,  you  jes’  don’t  have  no  idea.  These  bugs,  they  very,  very  teeny—no  bigger’n  a</p>
      <p>pinpoint. An’, man, what they do is get you by the short hair an’ hang on, an’ drill, down inside you,</p>
      <p>Geo’ge.”</p>
      <p>“No bugs!” George said.</p>
      <p>“Ahhh, let me tell you, Geo’ge: I seen cases where these awful bugs achually—”</p>
      <p>“Okay, Washington,” McMurphy said.</p>
      <p>The scar where the black boy’s nose had been broken was a twist of neon. The black boy knew</p>
      <p>who’d spoken to him, but he didn’t turn around; the only way we knew he’d even heard was by the</p>
      <p>way he stopped talking and reached up a long gray finger and drew it across the scar he’d got in that</p>
      <p>basketball game. He rubbed his nose a second, then shoved his hand out in front of [229] George’s</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>150</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>face, scrabbling the fingers around. “A crab, Geo’ge, see? See here? Now you know what a crab look</p>
      <p>like, don’t you? Sure now, you get crabs on that fishin’ boat. We can’t have crabs drillin’ down into</p>
      <p>you, can we, Geo’ge?”</p>
      <p>“No crabs!” George yelled. “No!” He stood straight and his brow lifted enough so we could see</p>
      <p>his eyes. The black boy stepped back a ways. The other two laughed at him. “Somethin’ the matter,</p>
      <p>Washington, my man?” the big one asked. “Somethin’ holding up this end of the pro-ceedure, my</p>
      <p>man?”</p>
      <p>He stepped back in close. “Geo’ge, I’m tellin’ you: bend down! You either bend down and take</p>
      <p>this stuff—or I lay my hand on you!” He held it up again; it was big and black as a swamp. “Put this</p>
      <p>black! filthy! stinkin’! hand all over you!”</p>
      <p>“No hand!” George said and lifted a fist above his head as if he would crash the slate skull to bits,</p>
      <p>splatter  cogs  and  nuts  and bolts  all  over  the  floor.  But  the  black  boy  just  ran  the  tube  up  against</p>
      <p>George’s  belly-button  and  squeezed,  and  George  doubled  over  with  a  suck  of  air.  The  black  boy</p>
      <p>squirted a load  in his whispy white hair, then rubbed it in with his hand, smearing black from his</p>
      <p>hand all over George’s head. George wrapped both arms around his belly and screamed.</p>
      <p>“No! No!”</p>
      <p>“Now turn around, Geo’ge—”</p>
      <p>“I said that’s enough, buddy.” This time the way his voice sounded made the black boy turn and</p>
      <p>face him. I saw the black boy was smiling, looking at McMurphy’s nakedness—no hat or boots or</p>
      <p>pockets to hook his thumbs into. The black boy grinned up and down him.</p>
      <p>“McMurphy,” he said, shaking his head. “Y’know, I was beginnin’ to think we might never get</p>
      <p>down to it.”</p>
      <p>“You goddamned coon,” McMurphy said, somehow sounding more tired than mad. The black</p>
      <p>boy didn’t say anything. McMurphy raised his voice. “Goddamned motherfucking nigger!”</p>
      <p>The black boy shook his head and giggled at his two buddies. “What you think Mr. McMurphy is</p>
      <p>drivin’ at with that kind of talk, man? You think he wants me to take the initiative? Heeheehee. Don’t</p>
      <p>he know we trained to take such awful-soundin’ insults from these crazies?”</p>
      <p>“Cocksucker! Washington, you’re nothing but a—”</p>
      <p>Washington  bad  turned  his  back  on  him, turning  to  George  again.  George  was  still  bent  over,</p>
      <p>gasping  from  the  blow  of  that  salve  in  his  belly.  The  black  boy  grabbed his  arm  and  swung  ‘him</p>
      <p>facing the wall.</p>
      <p>“Tha’s right, Geo’ge, now spread those cheeks.”</p>
      <p>[230] “No-o-o!”</p>
      <p>“Washington,”  McMurphy  said.  He  took  a  deep  breath  and  stepped  across  to  the  black  boy,</p>
      <p>shoving him away from George. “Washington, all right, all right ...”</p>
      <p>Everybody could hear the helpless, cornered despair in McMurphy’s voice.</p>
      <p>“McMurphy,  you  forcing  me  to  protect  myself.  Ain’t  he  forcing  me,  men?”  The  other  two</p>
      <p>nodded.  He carefully  laid  down  the  tube on  the bench  beside George,  came back  up  with  his  fist</p>
      <p>swinging  all  in  the  same motion  and  busting  McMurphy  across  the  cheek  by  surprise.  McMurphy</p>
      <p>nearly fell. He staggered backward into the naked line of men, and the guys caught him and pushed</p>
      <p>him back toward the smiling slate face. He got hit again, in the neck, before he gave up to the idea</p>
      <p>that it had started, at last, and there wasn’t anything now but get what he could out of it. He caught</p>
      <p>the next swing blacksnaking at him, and held him by the wrist while he shook his head clear.</p>
      <p>They swayed a second that way, panting along with the panting drain; then McMurphy shoved</p>
      <p>the black boy away and went into a crouch, rolling the big shoulders up to guard his chin, his fists</p>
      <p>on each side of his head, circling the man in front of him.</p>
      <p>And that neat, silent line of nude men changed into a yelling circle, limbs and bodies knitting in a</p>
      <p>ring of flesh.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>151</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>The black arms stabbed in at the lowered red head and bull neck, chipped blood off the brow</p>
      <p>and  the cheek.  The black  boy  danced  away.  Taller,  arms  longer than McMurphy’s thick  red  arms,</p>
      <p>punches faster and sharper, he was able to chisel at the shoulders and the head without getting in</p>
      <p>close.  McMurphy  kept  walking  forward—trudging,  flatfooted  steps,  face  down  and  squinting  up</p>
      <p>between those tattooed fists on each side of his head—till he got the black boy against the ring of</p>
      <p>nude men and drove a fist square in the center of the white, starched chest. That slate face cracked</p>
      <p>pink,  ran  a  tongue  the  color  of  strawberry  ice  cream  over  the  lips.  He  ducked  away  from</p>
      <p>McMurphy’s tank charge and got in another couple of licks before that fist laid him another good</p>
      <p>one. The mouth flew open wider this time, a blotch of sick color.</p>
      <p>McMurphy  had  red marks  on  the  head  and  shoulders,  but  he  didn’t  seem to be  hurt.  He  kept</p>
      <p>coming, taking ten blows for one. It kept on this way, back and forth in the shower room, till the</p>
      <p>black  boy  was  panting  and  staggering  and  working  mainly  at  keeping  out  of  the  way  of  those</p>
      <p>clubbing red arms. The guys were yelling for McMurphy to lay him out. McMurphy didn’t act in any</p>
      <p>hurry.</p>
      <p>[231] The black boy spun away from a blow on his shoulder and looked quick to where the other</p>
      <p>two were watching. “Williams … Warren ... damn you!” The other big one pulled the crowd apart</p>
      <p>and grabbed McMurphy around the arms from behind. McMurphy shook him off like a bull shaking</p>
      <p>off a monkey, but he was right back.</p>
      <p>So I picked him off and threw him in the shower. He was full of tubes; he didn’t weigh more’n</p>
      <p>ten or fifteen pounds.</p>
      <p>The least black boy swung his head from side to side, turned, and ran for the door. While I was</p>
      <p>watching him go, the other one came out of the shower and put a wrestling hold on me—arms up</p>
      <p>under mine from behind and hands locked behind my neck—and I had to run backward into the</p>
      <p>shower  and  mash  him  against  the  tile,  and  while  I  was  lying  there  in  the  water  trying  to  watch</p>
      <p>McMurphy bust some more of Washington’s ribs, the one behind me with the wrestling hold went</p>
      <p>to  biting  my  neck  and  I  had  to  break  the  hold.  He  laid  still  then,  the  starch  washing  from  the</p>
      <p>uniform down the choking drain.</p>
      <p>And by the time the least black boy came running back in with straps and cuffs and blankets and</p>
      <p>four  more  aides  from  Disturbed,  everybody  was  getting  dressed  and  shaking  my  hand  and</p>
      <p>McMurphy’s hand and saying they had it coming and what a rip-snorter of a fight it had been, what</p>
      <p>a tremendous big victory. They kept talking like that, to cheer us up and make us feel better, about</p>
      <p>what  a  fight,  what  a  victory—as  the  Big  Nurse helped  the  aides  from Disturbed  adjust  those  soft</p>
      <p>leather cuffs to fit our arms.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>152</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>27</p>
      <p>Up on Disturbed there’s an everlasting high-pitched machine-room clatter, a prison mill stamping</p>
      <p>out license plates. And time is measured out by the di-dock, di-dock of a Ping-pong table. Men pacing</p>
      <p>their personal runways get to a wall and dip a shoulder and turn and pace back to another wall, dip a</p>
      <p>shoulder and turn and back again, fast short steps, wearing crisscrossing ruts in the tile floor, with a</p>
      <p>look  of  caged  thirst.  There’s  a  singed  smell  of  men  scared  berserk  and  out  of  control,  and  in  the</p>
      <p>corners and under the Ping-pong table there’s things crouched gnashing their teeth that the doctors</p>
      <p>and nurses can’t see and the aides can’t kill with disinfectant. When the ward door opened I smelled</p>
      <p>that singed smell and heard that gnash of teeth.</p>
      <p>A  tall  bony  old  guy,  dangling  from  a  wire  screwed  in  between  his  shoulder  blades,  met</p>
      <p>McMurphy and me at the door when the aides brought us in. He looked us over with yellow, scaled</p>
      <p>eyes and shook his head. “I wash my hands of the whole deal,” he told one of the colored aides, and</p>
      <p>the wire drug him off down the hall.</p>
      <p>We followed him down to the day room, and McMurphy stopped at the door and spread his feet</p>
      <p>and tipped his head back to look things over: he tried to put his thumbs in his pockets, but the cuffs</p>
      <p>were too tight. “It’s a scene,” he said out of the side of his mouth. I nodded my head. I’d seen it all</p>
      <p>before.</p>
      <p>A couple of the guys pacing stopped to look at us, and the old bony man came dragging by again,</p>
      <p>washing his hands of the whole deal. Nobody paid us much mind at first. The aides went off to the</p>
      <p>Nurses’ Station, leaving us standing  in the dayroom door. Murphy’s eye was puffed to give him a</p>
      <p>steady wink, and I could tell it hurt his lips to grin. He raised his cuffed hands and stood looking at</p>
      <p>the clatter of movement and took a deep breath.</p>
      <p>“McMurphy’s the name, pardners,” he said in his drawling cowboy actor’s voice, “an’ the thing I</p>
      <p>want to know is who’s the peckerwood runs the poker game in this establishment?”</p>
      <p>The Ping-pong clock died down in a rapid ticking on the floor.</p>
      <p>“I don’t deal blackjack so good, hobbled like this, but I maintain I’m a fire-eater in a stud game.”</p>
      <p>He yawned, hitched a shoulder, bent down and cleared his [233] throat, and spat something at a</p>
      <p>wastepaper  can  five  feet  away;  it  rattled  in  with  a  ting  and  he  straightened  up  again,  grinned,  and</p>
      <p>licked his tongue at the bloody gap in his teeth.</p>
      <p>“Had a run-in downstairs. Me an’ the Chief here locked horns with two greasemonkeys.”</p>
      <p>All the stamp-mill racket had stopped by this time, and everybody was looking toward the two of</p>
      <p>us at the door. McMurphy drew eyes to him like a sideshow barker. Beside him, I found that I was</p>
      <p>obliged to be looked at too, and with people staring at me I felt I had to stand up straight and tall as</p>
      <p>I  could.  That made my back  hurt  where I’d  fallen in  the  shower  with the  black  boy on  me, but  I</p>
      <p>didn’t let on. One hungry looker with a head of shaggy black hair came up and held his hand like he</p>
      <p>figured  I  had  something  for  him.  I  tried  to  ignore  him,  but  he  kept  running  around  in  front  of</p>
      <p>whichever way I turned, like a little kid, holding that empty hand cupped out to me.</p>
      <p>McMurphy  talked  a  while  about  the  fight,  and  my  back  got  to  hurting  more  and  more..  I’d</p>
      <p>hunkered in my chair in the corner for so long that it was hard to stand straight very long. I was glad</p>
      <p>when a little lap nurse came to take us into the Nurses’ Station and I got a chance to sit and rest.</p>
      <p>She asked if we were calm enough for her to take off the cuffs, and McMurphy nodded. He had</p>
      <p>slumped  over  with  his  head  hung  and  his  elbows  between  his  knees  and  looked  completely</p>
      <p>exhausted—it hadn’t occurred to me that it was just as hard for him to stand straight as it was for</p>
      <p>me.</p>
      <p>The nurse—about as big as the small end of nothing whittled to a fine point, as McMurphy put it</p>
      <p>later—undid  our  cuffs  and  gave  McMurphy  a  cigarette  and  gave  me  a  stick  of  gum.  She  said  she</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>153</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>remembered that I chewed gum. I didn’t remember her at all. McMurphy smoked while she dipped</p>
      <p>her little hand full of pink birthday candles into a jar of salve  and worked over his cuts, flinching</p>
      <p>every time he flinched and telling him she was sorry. She picked up one of his hands in both of hers</p>
      <p>and turned it over and salved his knuckles. “Who was it?” she asked, looking at the knuckles. “Was</p>
      <p>it Washington or Warren?”</p>
      <p>McMurphy looked up at her. “Washington,” he said and grinned. “The Chief here took care of</p>
      <p>Warren.”</p>
      <p>She put his hand down and turned to me. I could see the little bird bones in her face. “Are you</p>
      <p>hurt anywhere?” I shook my head.</p>
      <p>“What about Warren and Williams?”</p>
      <p>McMurphy told her he thought they might be sporting some [234] plaster the next time she saw</p>
      <p>them. She nodded and looked at her feet. “It’s not all like her ward,” she said. “A lot of it is, but not</p>
      <p>all. Army nurses, trying to run an Army hospital. They are a little sick themselves. 1 sometimes think</p>
      <p>all single nurses should be fired after they reach thirty-five.”</p>
      <p>“At least all single Army nurses,” McMurphy added. He asked how long we could expect to have</p>
      <p>the pleasure of her hospitality.</p>
      <p>“Not very long, I’m afraid.”</p>
      <p>“Not very long, you’re afraid?” McMurphy asked her.</p>
      <p>“Yes. I’d like to keep men here sometimes instead of sending them back, but she has seniority.</p>
      <p>No, you probably won’t be very long—I mean—like you are now.”</p>
      <p>The beds on Disturbed are all out of tune, too taut or too loose. We were assigned beds next to</p>
      <p>each  other.  They  didn’t  tie  a  sheet  across  me,  though  they  left  a  little  dim  light  on  near  the  bed.</p>
      <p>Halfway through the night somebody screamed, “I’m starting to spin, Indian! Look me, look me!” I</p>
      <p>opened  my  eyes  and  saw  a  set  of  long  yellow  teeth  glowing  right  in  front  of  my  face.  It  was  the</p>
      <p>hungry-looking guy. “I’m starting to spin! Please look me!”</p>
      <p>The aides got him from behind, two of them, dragged him laughing and yelling out of the dorm;</p>
      <p>“I’m starting to spin, Indian!”—then just laugh. He kept saying it and laughing all the way down the</p>
      <p>hall till the dorm was quiet again, and I could hear that one other guy saying, “Well ... I wash my</p>
      <p>hands of the whole deal.”</p>
      <p>“You had you a buddy for a second there, Chief,” McMurphy whispered and rolled over to sleep.</p>
      <p>I couldn’t sleep much the rest of the night and I kept seeing those yellow teeth and that guy’s hungry</p>
      <p>face,  asking  to  Look  me!  Look  me!  Or,  finally,  as  I  did  get  to  sleep,  just  asking.  That  face,  just  a</p>
      <p>yellow, starved need, come looming out of the dark in front of me, wanting things ... asking things. I</p>
      <p>wondered  how  McMurphy  slept,  plagued  by  a  hundred  faces  like  that,  or  two  hundred,  or  a</p>
      <p>thousand.</p>
      <p>They’ve got an alarm on Disturbed to wake the patients. They don’t just turn on the lights like</p>
      <p>downstairs.  This  alarm  sounds  like  a  gigantic  pencil-sharpener  grinding  up  something  awful.</p>
      <p>McMurphy and I both sat bolt upright when we heard it and were about to lie back down when a</p>
      <p>loudspeaker called for the two of us to come to the Nurses’ Station. I got out of bed, and my back</p>
      <p>had  stiffened  up  overnight  to  where  I  could  just  barely  bend;  I  could  tell  by  the  way  McMurphy</p>
      <p>gimped around that he was as stiff as I was.</p>
      <p>[235] “What they got on the program for us now, Chief?” he asked. “The boot? The rack? I hope</p>
      <p>nothing too strenuous, because, man, am I stove up bad!”</p>
      <p>I told him it wasn’t strenuous, but I didn’t tell him anything else, because I wasn’t sure myself till</p>
      <p>I  got  to  the  Nurses’  Station,  and  the  nurse,  a  different  one,  said,  “Mr.  McMurphy  and  Mr.</p>
      <p>Bromden?” then handed us each a little paper cup.</p>
      <p>I looked in mine, and there are three of those red capsules. This tsing whirs in any head I can’t</p>
      <p>stop.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>154</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Hold on,” McMurphy says. “These are those knockout pills, aren’t they?”</p>
      <p>The  nurse  nods,  twists  her  head  to  check  behind  her;  there’s  two  guys  waiting  with  ice  tongs,</p>
      <p>hunching forward with their elbows linked.</p>
      <p>McMurphy  hands  back  the  cup,  says,  “No  sir,  ma’am,  but  I’ll  forgo  the  blindfold.  Could  use  a</p>
      <p>cigarette, though.”</p>
      <p>I hand mine back too, and she says she must phone and she slips the glass door across between</p>
      <p>us, is at the phone before anybody can say anything else.</p>
      <p>“I’m sorry if I got you into something, Chief,” McMurphy says, and I barely can hear him over</p>
      <p>the noise of the phone wires whistling in the walls. I can feel the scared downhill rush of thoughts in</p>
      <p>my head.</p>
      <p>We’re sitting in the day room, those faces around us in a circle, when in the door comes the Big</p>
      <p>Nurse herself, the two big black boys on each side, a step behind her. I try to shrink down in my</p>
      <p>chair, away from her, but it’s too late. Too many people looking at me; sticky eyes hold me where I</p>
      <p>sit.</p>
      <p>“Good morning,”  she  says,  got  her  old  smile  back  now.  McMurphy  says  good  morning,  and  I</p>
      <p>keep quiet even though she says good morning to me too, out loud. I’m watching the black boys;</p>
      <p>one has tape on his nose and his arm in a sling, gray hand dribbling out of the cloth like a drowned</p>
      <p>spider, and the other one is moving like he’s got some kind of cast around his ribs. They are both</p>
      <p>grinning a little. Probably could of stayed home with their hurts, but wouldn’t miss this for nothing.</p>
      <p>I grin back just to show them.</p>
      <p>The  Big  Nurse  talks  to  McMurphy,  soft  and  patient,  about  the  irresponsible  thing  he  did,  the</p>
      <p>childish thing, throwing a tantrum like a little boy—aren’t you ashamed? He says he guesses not and</p>
      <p>tells her to get on with it.</p>
      <p>She talks to him about how they, the patients downstairs on our ward, at a special group meeting</p>
      <p>yesterday  afternoon,  agreed  with  the  staff  that  it  might  be  beneficial  that  he  receive  some  shock</p>
      <p>therapy—unless he realizes his mistakes. All he has [236] to do is admit he was wrong, to indicate,</p>
      <p>demonstrate rational contact, and the treatment would be canceled this time.</p>
      <p>That circle of faces waits and watches. The nurse says it’s up to him.</p>
      <p>“Yeah?” he says. “You got a paper I can sign?”</p>
      <p>“Well, no, but if you feel it nec—”</p>
      <p>“And  why  don’t  you  add  some  other  things  while  you’re  at  it  and  get  them  out  of  the  way—</p>
      <p>things like, oh, me being part of a plot to overthrow the government and like how I think life on</p>
      <p>your ward is the sweetest goddamned life this side of Hawaii—you know, that sort of crap.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t believe that would—”</p>
      <p>“Then, after I sign, you bring me a blanket and a package of Red Cross cigarettes. Hooee, those</p>
      <p>Chinese Commies could have learned a few things from you, lady.”</p>
      <p>“Randle, we are trying to help you.”</p>
      <p>But he’s on his feet, scratching at his belly, walking on past her and the black boys rearing back,</p>
      <p>toward the card tables. “O-kay, well well well, where’s this poker table, buddies ...?”</p>
      <p>The nurse stares after him a moment, then walks into the Nurses’ Station to use the phone.</p>
      <p>Two  colored  aides  and  a  white  aide  with  curly  blond  hair  walk  us  over  to  the  Main  Building.</p>
      <p>McMurphy talks with the white aide on the way over, just like he isn’t worried about a thing.</p>
      <p>There’s  frost  thick  on  the  grass,  and  the  two  colored  aides  in  front  trail  puffs  of  breath  like</p>
      <p>locomotives. The sun wedges apart some of the clouds and lights up the frost till the grounds are</p>
      <p>scattered with sparks. Sparrows fluffed out against the cold, scratching among the sparks for seeds.</p>
      <p>We cut across the crackling grass, past the digger squirrel holes where I saw the dog. Cold sparks.</p>
      <p>Frost down the holes, clear out of sight.</p>
      <p>I feel that frost in my belly.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>155</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>We get up to that door, and there’s a sound behind like bees stirred up. Two men in front of us,</p>
      <p>reeling under the red capsules, one bawling like a baby, saying, “It’s my cross, thank you Lord, it’s all</p>
      <p>I got, thank you Lord. ...”</p>
      <p>The other guy waiting is saying, “Guts ball, guts ball.” He’s the lifeguard from the pool. And he’s</p>
      <p>crying a little too.</p>
      <p>I won’t cry or yell. Not with McMurphy here.</p>
      <p>The technician asks us to take off our shoes, and McMurphy asks him if we get our pants slit and</p>
      <p>our heads shaved too. The technician says no such luck.</p>
      <p>The metal door looks out with its rivet eyes.</p>
      <p>[237] The door opens, sucks the first man inside. The lifeguard won’t budge. A beam like neon</p>
      <p>smoke comes out of the black panel in the room, fastens on his cleat-marked forehead and drags</p>
      <p>him in like a dog on a leash. The beam spins him around three times before the door closes, and his</p>
      <p>face is scrambled fear. “Hut one,” he grunts. “Hut two! Hut three!”</p>
      <p>I hear them in there pry up his forehead like a manhole cover, clash and snarl of jammed cogs.</p>
      <p>Smoke blows the door open, and a Gurney comes out with the first man on it, and he rakes me</p>
      <p>with his eyes. That face. The Gurney goes back in and brings the lifeguard out. I can hear the yell-</p>
      <p>leaders spelling out his name.</p>
      <p>The technician says, “Next group.”</p>
      <p>The floor’s cold, frosted, crackling. Up above the light whines, tube long and white and icy. Can</p>
      <p>smell the graphite salve, like the smell in a garage. Can smell acid of fear. There’s one window, up</p>
      <p>high,  small,  and  outside  I  see  those  puffy  sparrows  strung  up  on  a  wire  like  brown  beads.  Their</p>
      <p>heads sunk in the feathers against the cold. Something goes to blowing wind over my hollow bones,</p>
      <p>higher and higher, air raid! air raid!</p>
      <p>“Don’t holler, Chief. …”</p>
      <p>Air raid!</p>
      <p>“Take ‘er easy. I’ll go first. My skull’s too thick for them to hurt me. And if they can’t hurt me</p>
      <p>they can’t hurt you.”</p>
      <p>Climbs on the table without any help and spreads his arms out to fit the shadow. A switch snaps</p>
      <p>the clasps on his wrists, ankles, clamping him into the shadow. A hand takes off his wristwatch, won</p>
      <p>it  from  Scanion,  drops  it  near  the  panel,  it  springs  open,  cogs  and  wheels  and  the  long  dribbling</p>
      <p>spiral of spring jumping against the side of the panel and sticking fast.</p>
      <p>He don’t look a bit scared. He keeps grinning at me.</p>
      <p>They put the graphite salve on his temples. “What is it?” he says. “Conductant,” the technician</p>
      <p>says. “Anointest my head with conductant. Do I get a crown of thorns?”</p>
      <p>They smear it on. He’s singing to them, makes their hands shake.</p>
      <p>“ ‘Get Wildroot Cream Oil, Cholly. ...’ ”</p>
      <p>Put  on  those  things  like  headphones,  crown  of  silver  thorns  over  the  graphite  at  his  temples.</p>
      <p>They try to hush his singing with a piece of rubber hose for him to bite on.</p>
      <p>“ ‘Mage with thoothing lan-o-lin.’ ”</p>
      <p>Twist some dials, and the machine trembles, two robot arms pick up soldering irons and hunch</p>
      <p>down  on  him.  He  gives  me  the  wink  and  speaks  to  me,  muffled,  tells  me  something,  says  [238]</p>
      <p>something to me around that rubber hose just as those irons get close enough to the silver on his</p>
      <p>temples—light  arcs  across,  stiffens  him,  bridges  him  up  off  the  table  till  nothing  is  down  but  his</p>
      <p>wrists and ankles and out around that crimped black rubber hose a sound like hooeee! and he’s frosted</p>
      <p>over completely with sparks.</p>
      <p>And out the window the sparrows drop smoking off the wire.</p>
      <p>They  roll  him  out  on  a  Gurney,  still  jerking,  face  frosted  white.  Corrosion.  Battery  acid.  The</p>
      <p>technician turns to me.</p>

      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>Watch that other moose. I know him. Hold him!</p>
      <p>It’s not a will-power thing any more.</p>
      <p>Hold him! Damn. No more of these boys without Seconal.</p>
      <p>The clamps bite my wrists and ankles.</p>
      <p>The graphite salve has iron filings in it, temples scratching.</p>
      <p>He said something when he winked. Told me something.</p>
      <p>Man bends over, brings two irons toward the ring on my head.</p>
      <p>The machine hunches on me.</p>
      <p>AIR RAID.</p>
      <p>Hit  at  a  lope,  running  already  down  the  slope.  Can’t  get  back,  can’t  go  ahead,  look  down  the</p>
      <p>barrel an’ you dead dead dead.</p>
      <p>We come up outa the bullreeds run beside the railroad track. I lay an ear to the track, and it burns</p>
      <p>my cheek.</p>
      <p>“Nothin’ either way,” I say, “a hundred miles ...”</p>
      <p>“Hump,” Papa says.</p>
      <p>“Didn’t we used to listen for buffalo by stickin’ a  knife in the ground, catch the handle in our</p>
      <p>teeth, hear a herd way off?”</p>
      <p>“Hump,”  he  says  again,  but  he’s  tickled.  Out  across  the  other  side  of  the  track  a  fencerow  of</p>
      <p>wheat chats from last winter. Mice under that stuff, the dog says.</p>
      <p>“Do we go up the track or down the track, boy?”</p>
      <p>“We go across, is what the ol’ dog says.”</p>
      <p>“That dog don’t heel.”</p>
      <p>“He’ll do. There’s birds over there is what the of dog says.”</p>
      <p>“Better hunting up the track bank is what your ol’ man says.”</p>
      <p>“Best right across in the chats of wheat, the dog tells me.”</p>
      <p>Across—next  thing  I  know  there’s  people  all  over  the  track,  blasting  away  at  pheasants  like</p>
      <p>anything. Seems our dog got too far out ahead and run all the birds outa the chats to the track.</p>
      <p>Dog got three mice.</p>
      <p>… man, Man, MAN, MAN ... broad and big with a wink like a star.</p>
      <p>[239]  Ants  again  oh  Jesus  and  I  got  ‘em  bad  this  time,  prickle-footed  bastards.  Remember  the</p>
      <p>time we found those ants tasted like dill pickles? Hee? You said it wasn’t dill pickles and I said it was,</p>
      <p>and your mama kicked the living tar outa me when she heard: Teachin’ a kid to eat bugs!</p>
      <p>Ugh.  Good  Injun boy  should  know how to  survive  on  anything  he  can eat  that  won’t  eat him</p>

      <p>Ting. Tingle, tingle, tremble toes, she’s a good fisherman, catches hens, puts ‘em inna pens ... wire</p>
      <p>blier, limber lock, three geese inna flock ... one flew east, one flew west, one flew over the cuckoo’s</p>
      <p>nest ... O-U-T spells out ... goose swoops down and plucks you out.</p>
      <p>My  old  grandma  chanted  this,  a  game  we  played  by  the  hours,  sitting  by the  fish  racks  scaring</p>
      <p>flies. A game called Tingle Tingle Tangle Toes. Counting each finger on my two outspread hands,</p>
      <p>one finger to a syllable as she chants.</p>
      <p>Tingle, ting-le, tang-le toes (seven fingers) she’s a good fisherman, catches hens (sixteen fingers,</p>
      <p>tapping a finger on each beat with her black crab hand, each of my fingernails looking up at her like</p>
      <p>a little face asking to be the you that the goose swoops down and plucks out).</p>
      <p>I like the game and I like Grandma. I don’t like Mrs. Tingle Tangle Toes, catching hens. I don’t</p>
      <p>like her. I do like that goose flying over the cuckoo’s nest. I like him, and I like Grandma, dust in her</p>
      <p>wrinkles.</p>
      <p>Next time I saw her she was stone cold dead, right in the middle of The Dalles on the sidewalk,</p>
      <p>colored shirts standing [240] around, some Indians, some cattlemen, some wheatmen. They cart her</p>
      <p>down to the city burying ground, roll red clay into her eyes.</p>
      <p>I remember hot, still electric-storm afternoons when jackrabbits ran under Diesel truck wheels.</p>
      <p>Joey Fish-in-a-Barrel has twenty thousand dollars and three Cadillacs since the contract. And he</p>
      <p>can’t drive none of ‘em.</p>
      <p>I see a dice.</p>
      <p>I see it from the inside, me at the bottom. I’m the weight, loading the dice to throw that number</p>
      <p>one up there above me. They got the dice loaded to throw a snake eyes, and I’m the load, six lumps</p>
      <p>around me like white pillows is the other side of the dice, the number six that will always be down</p>
      <p>when he throws. What’s the other dice loaded for? I bet it’s loaded to throw one too. Snake eyes.</p>
      <p>They’re shooting with crookies against him, and I’m the load.</p>
      <p>Look out, here comes a toss. Ay, lady, the smokehouse is empty and baby needs a new pair of</p>

      <p>Crapped out.</p>
      <p>Water. I’m lying in a puddle.</p>

      <p>behind the feedstore in an alley—in Portland.</p>
      <p>The alley is a tunnel it’s cold because the sun is late afternoon. Let me ... go see Grandma. Please,</p>

      <p>What was it he said when he winked?</p>
      <p>One flew east one flew west.</p>

      <p>Yeah, that’s right.</p>

      <p>Yeah.</p>
      <p>Well ... three dollars of regular.</p>

      <p>[241] After Grandma’s funeral me and Papa and Uncle Runningand-Jumping Wolf dug her up.</p>
      <p>Mama wouldn’t go with us; she never heard of such a thing. Hanging a corpse in a tree! It’s enough</p>
      <p>to make a person sick.</p>
      <p>Uncle  R  &amp;  J  Wolf  and  Papa  spent  twenty  days  in  the  drunk  tank  at  The  Dalles  jail,  playing</p>
      <p>rummy, for Violation of the Dead.</p>
      <p>But she’s our goddanged mother!</p>
      <p>It  doesn’t make  the  slightest  difference,  boys.  You shoulda  left  her  buried. I  don’t  know  when</p>
      <p>you blamed Indians will learn. Now, where is she? you’d better tell.</p>
      <p>Ah go fuck yourself, paleface, Uncle R &amp; J said, rolling himself a cigarette. I’ll never tell.</p>
      <p>High  high  high  in  the  hills,  high  in  a  pine  tree  bed,  she’s  tracing  the  wind  with  that  old  hand,</p>
      <p>counting the clouds with that old chant: ... three geese in a flock …</p>
      <p>What did you say to me when you winked?</p>
      <p>Band playing. Look—the sky, it’s the Fourth of July.</p>
      <p>Dice at rest.</p>
      <p>They got to me with the machine again ... I wonder ...</p>
      <p>What did he say?</p>
      <p>… wonder how McMurphy made me big again.</p>
      <p>He said Guts ball.</p>
      <p>They’re  out  there.  Black  boys  in  white  suits  peeing  under  the  door  on  me,  come  in  later  and</p>
      <p>accuse me of soaking all six these pillows I’m lying on! Number six. I thought the room was a dice.</p>
      <p>The number one, the snake eye up there, the circle, the white light in the ceiling ... is what I’ve been</p>
      <p>seeing ... in this little square room ... means it’s after dark. How many hours have I been out? It’s</p>
      <p>fogging a little, but I won’t slip off and hide in it. No ... never again ...</p>
      <p>I stand, stood up slowly, feeling numb between the shoulders. The white pillows on the floor of</p>
      <p>the Seclusion Room were soaked from me peeing on them while I was out. I couldn’t remember all</p>
      <p>of it yet, but I rubbed my eyes with the heels of my hands and tried to clear my head. I worked at it.</p>
      <p>I’d never worked at coming out of it before.</p>
      <p>I staggered toward the little round chicken-wired window in the door of the room and tapped it</p>
      <p>with my knuckles. I saw an aide coming up the hall with a tray for me and knew this time I had them</p>
      <p>beat.</p>

      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>28</p>
      <p>There had been times when I’d wandered around in a daze for as long as two weeks after a shock</p>
      <p>treatment, living in that foggy, jumbled blur which is a whole lot like the ragged edge of sleep, that</p>
      <p>gray zone between light and dark, or between sleeping and waking or living and dying, where you</p>
      <p>know you’re not unconscious any more but don’t know yet what day it is or who you are or what’s</p>
      <p>the use of coming back at all—for two weeks. If you don’t have a reason to wake up you can loaf</p>
      <p>around in that gray zone for a long, fuzzy time, or if you want to bad enough I found you can come</p>
      <p>fighting right out of it. This time I came fighting out of it in less than a day, less time than ever.</p>
      <p>And when the fog was finally swept from my head it seemed like I’d just come up after a long,</p>
      <p>deep  dive,  breaking  the  surface  after being  under water  a  hundred  years.  It  was  the  last  treatment</p>
      <p>they gave me.</p>
      <p>They  gave  McMurphy  three  more  treatments  that  week.  As  quick  as  he  started  coming  out  of</p>
      <p>one, getting the click back in his wink, Miss Ratched would arrive with the doctor and they would</p>
      <p>ask him if he felt like he was ready to come around and face up to his problem and come back to the</p>
      <p>ward for a cure. And he’d swell up, aware that every one of those faces on Disturbed had turned</p>
      <p>toward him and was waiting, and he’d tell the nurse he regretted that he had but one life to give for</p>
      <p>his country and she could kiss his rosy red ass before he’d give up the goddam ship. Yeh!</p>
      <p>Then stand up and take a couple of bows to those guys grinning at him while the nurse led the</p>
      <p>doctor into the station to phone over to the Main Building and authorize another treatment.</p>
      <p>Once, as she turned to walk away, he got hold of her through the back of her uniform, gave her a</p>
      <p>pinch  that  turned  her  face  red  as  his  hair.  I  think  if  the  doctor  hadn’t  been  there,  hiding  a  grin</p>
      <p>himself, she would’ve slapped McMurphy’s face.</p>
      <p>I  tried  to  talk  him  into  playing  along  with  her  so’s  to  get  out  of  the  treatments,  but  he  just</p>
      <p>laughed  and  told  me  Hell,  all  they  was  doin’  was  chargin’  his  battery  for  him,  free  for  nothing.</p>
      <p>“When I get out of here the first woman that takes [243] on ol’ Red McMurphy the ten-thousand-</p>
      <p>watt psychopath, she’s gonna light up like a pinball machine and pay off in silver dollars! No, I ain’t</p>
      <p>scared of their little battery-charger.”</p>
      <p>He  insisted  it  wasn’t  hurting  him.  He  wouldn’t  even  take  his  capsules.  But  every  time  that</p>
      <p>loudspeaker called for him to forgo breakfast and prepare to walk to Building One, the muscles in</p>
      <p>his jaw went taut and his whole face drained of color, looking thin and scared—the face I had seen</p>
      <p>reflected in the windshield on the trip back from the coast.</p>
      <p>I left Disturbed at the end of the week and went back to the ward. I had a lot of things I wanted</p>
      <p>to say to him before I went, but he’d just come back from a treatment and was sitting following the</p>
      <p>ping-pong ball with his eyes like he was  wired to it. The colored aide and the blond one took me</p>
      <p>downstairs and let me onto our ward and locked the door behind me. The ward seemed awful quiet</p>
      <p>after  Disturbed.  I  walked  to our  day room  and  for  some  reason  stopped  at  the  door;  everybody’s</p>
      <p>face turned up to me with a different look than they’d ever given me before. Their faces lighted up</p>
      <p>as  if  they  were  looking  into  the  glare  of  a  sideshow  platform.  “Here,  in  fronta  your  very  eyes,”</p>
      <p>Harding spiels, “is the Wildman who broke the arm … of the black boy! Hey-ha, lookee, lookee.” I</p>
      <p>grinned  back  at  them,  realizing  how  McMurphy  must’ve  felt  these  months  with  these  faces</p>
      <p>screaming up at him.</p>
      <p>All the guys came over and wanted me to tell them everything that had happened: how was he</p>
      <p>acting  up  there?  What  was  he  doing?  Was  it  true,  what  was  being  rumored  over  at  the  gym,  that</p>
      <p>they’d been hitting him every day with EST and he was shrugging it off like water, makin’ book with</p>
      <p>the technicians on how long he could keep his eyes open after the poles touched.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>160</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>I told them all I could, and nobody seemed to think a thing about me all of a sudden talking with</p>
      <p>people—a  guy  who’d  been  considered  deaf  and  dumb  as  far  back  as  they’d  known  him,  talking,</p>
      <p>listening, just like anybody. I told them everything that they’d heard was true, and tossed in a few</p>
      <p>stories of my own. They laughed so hard about some of the things he’d said to the nurse that the</p>
      <p>two  Vegetables  under  their  wet  sheets  on  the  Chronics’  side  grinned  and  snorted  along  with  the</p>
      <p>laughter, just like they understood.</p>
      <p>When the nurse herself brought the problem of Patient McMurphy up in group the next day, said</p>
      <p>that for some unusual reason he did not seem to be responding to EST at all and that more drastic</p>
      <p>means  might  be  required  to  make  contact  with  him,  Harding  said,  “Now,  that  is  possible,  Miss</p>
      <p>Ratched, yes— [244] but from what I hear about your dealings upstairs with McMurphy, he hasn’t</p>
      <p>had any difficulty making contact with you.”</p>
      <p>She was thrown off balance and flustered so bad with everybody in the room laughing at her, that</p>
      <p>she didn’t bring it up again.</p>
      <p>She  saw  that  McMurphy  was  growing  bigger  than  ever  while  he  was  upstairs  where  the  guys</p>
      <p>couldn’t see the dent she was making on him, growing almost into a legend. A man out of sight can’t</p>
      <p>be made to look weak, she decided, and started making plans to bring him back down to our ward.</p>
      <p>She figured the guys could see for themselves then that he could be as vulnerable as the next man.</p>
      <p>He couldn’t continue in his hero role if he was sitting around the day room all the time in a shock</p>
      <p>stupor.</p>
      <p>The guys anticipated this, and that as long as he was on the ward for them to see she would be</p>
      <p>giving him shock every time he came out of it. So Harding and Scanlon and Fredrickson and I talked</p>
      <p>over how we could convince him that the best thing for everybody concerned would be his escaping</p>
      <p>the ward. And by the Saturday when he was brought back to the ward—footworking into the day</p>
      <p>room  like  a  boxer  into  a  ring,  clasping  his  hands  over  his  head  and  announcing  the  champ  was</p>
      <p>back—we had our plan all worked out. We’d wait until dark, set a mattress on fire, and when the</p>
      <p>firemen came we’d rush him out the door. It seemed such a fine plan we couldn’t see how he could</p>
      <p>refuse.</p>
      <p>But we didn’t think about its being the day he’d made a date to have the girl, Candy, sneak onto</p>
      <p>the ward for Billy.</p>
      <p>They brought him back to the ward about ten in the morning—“Fulla piss an’ vinegar, buddies;</p>
      <p>they checked my plugs and cleaned my points, and I got a glow on like a Model T spark coil. Ever</p>
      <p>use one of those coils around Halloween time? Zam! Good clean fun.” And he batted around the</p>
      <p>ward bigger than ever, spilled a bucket of mop water under the Nurses’ Station door, laid a pat of</p>
      <p>butter square on the toe of the least black boy’s white suede shoes without the black boy noticing,</p>
      <p>and  smothered  giggles  all  through  lunch  while  it  melted  to  show  a  color  Harding  referred to  as  a</p>
      <p>“most suggestive yellow,”—bigger than ever, and each time he brushed close by a student nurse she</p>
      <p>gave a yip and rolled her eyes and pitter-patted off down the hall, rubbing her flank.</p>
      <p>We told him of our plan for his escape, and he told us there was no hurry and reminded us of</p>
      <p>Billy’s date. “We can’t disappoint Billy Boy, can we, buddies? Not when he’s about to [245] cash in</p>
      <p>his cherry. And it should be a nice little party tonight if we can pull  it off; let’s say maybe it’s my</p>
      <p>going-away party.”</p>
      <p>It was the Big Nurse’s weekend to work—she didn’t want to miss his return—and she decided</p>
      <p>we’d better have us a meeting to get something settled. At the meeting she tried once more to bring</p>
      <p>up her suggestion for a more drastic measure, insisting that the doctor consider such action “before</p>
      <p>it  is  too  late  to  help  the  patient.”  But  McMurphy  was  such  a  whirligig  of  winks  and  yawns  and</p>
      <p>belches  while  she  talked,  she  finally  hushed,  and  when  she  did,  he  gave  the  doctor  and  all  the</p>
      <p>patients fits by agreeing with everything she said.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>161</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Y’know, she might be right, Doc; look at the good that few measly volts have done me. Maybe</p>
      <p>if  we  doubled  the  charge  I  could  pick  up  channel  eight,  like  Martini;  I’m  tired  of  layin’  in  bed</p>
      <p>hallucinatin’ nothing but channel four with the news and weather.”</p>
      <p>The nurse cleared her throat, trying to regain control of her meeting. “I wasn’t suggesting that we</p>
      <p>consider more shock, Mr. McMurphy—”</p>
      <p>“Ma’am?”</p>
      <p>“I was suggesting—that we consider an operation. Very simple, really. And we’ve had a history of</p>
      <p>past successes eliminating aggressive tendencies in certain hostile cases—”</p>
      <p>“Hostile?  Ma’am,  I’m  friendly  as  a  pup.  I  haven’t  kicked  the  tar  out  of  an  aide  in  nearly  two</p>
      <p>weeks. There’s been no cause to do any cuttin’, now, has there?”</p>
      <p>She held out her smile, begging him to see how sympathetic she was. “Randle, there’s no cutting</p>
      <p>involve—”</p>
      <p>“Besides,”  he  went  on,  “it  wouldn’t  be  any  use  to  lop  ‘em  off;  I  got  another  pair  in  my</p>
      <p>nightstand.”</p>
      <p>“Another—pair?”</p>
      <p>“One about as big as a baseball, Doc.”</p>
      <p>“Mr. McMurphy!” Her smile broke like glass when she realized she was being made fun of.</p>
      <p>“But the other one is big enough to be considered normal.”</p>
      <p>He  went  on  like  this  clear  up  to  the  time  we  were  ready  for  bed.  By  then  there  was  a  festive,</p>
      <p>county-fair feeling on the ward as the men whispered of the possibility of having a party if the girl</p>
      <p>came with drinks. All the guys were trying to catch Billy’s eye and grinning and winking at him every</p>
      <p>time he looked. And when we lined up for medication McMurphy came by and asked the little nurse</p>
      <p>with the crucifix and the birthmark if he could have a couple of vitamins. She looked surprised and</p>
      <p>said she didn’t see that there was any reason why [246] not and gave him some pills the size of birds’</p>
      <p>eggs. He put them in his pocket.</p>
      <p>“Aren’t you going to swallow them?” she asked.</p>
      <p>“Me? Lord no, I don’t need vitamins. I was just gettin’ them for Billy Boy here. He seems to me</p>
      <p>to have a peaked look of late—tired blood, most likely.”</p>
      <p>“Then—why don’t you give them to Billy?”</p>
      <p>“I will, honey, I will, but I thought I’d wait till about midnight when he’d have the most need for</p>
      <p>them”—and walked to the dorm with his arm crooked around Billy’s flushing neck, giving Harding</p>
      <p>a wink and me a goose in the side with his big thumb as he passed us, and left that nurse pop-eyed</p>
      <p>behind him in the Nurses’ Station, pouring water on her foot.</p>
      <p>You have to know about Billy Bibbit: in spite of him having wrinkles in his face and specks of</p>
      <p>gray in his hair, he still looked like a kid—like a jug-eared and freckled-faced and buck-toothed kid</p>
      <p>whistling barefoot across one of those calendars, with a string of bullheads dragging behind him in</p>
      <p>the  dust—and  yet he  was  nothing  like  this.  You  were  always  surprised  to  find  when  he  stood  up</p>
      <p>next to one of the other men he was just as tall as anyone, and that he wasn’t jug-eared or freckled</p>
      <p>or buck-toothed at all under a closer look, and was, in fact, thirty-some years old.</p>
      <p>I heard him give his age only one time, overheard him, to tell the truth, when he was talking to</p>
      <p>his mother down in the lobby. She was receptionist down there, a solid, well-packed lady with hair</p>
      <p>revolving from blond to blue to black and back to blond again every few months, a neighbor of the</p>
      <p>Big Nurse’s, from what I’d heard, and a dear personal friend. Whenever we’d go on some activity</p>
      <p>Billy would always be obliged to stop and lean a scarlet cheek over that desk for her to dab a kiss on.</p>
      <p>It  embarrassed  the  rest of  us  as  much  as  it  did  Billy,  and  for that  reason nobody  ever teased him</p>
      <p>about it, not even McMurphy.</p>
      <p>One afternoon, I don’t recall how long back, we stopped on our way to activities and sat around</p>
      <p>the lobby on the big plastic sofas or outside in the two-o’clock sun while one of the black boys used</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>162</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>the  phone  to  call  his  bookmaker,  and  Billy’s  mother  took  the  opportunity  to  leave  her  work  and</p>
      <p>come out from behind her desk and take her boy by the hand and lead him outside to sit near where</p>
      <p>I was on the grass. She sat stiff there on the grass, tight at the bend with her short round legs out in</p>
      <p>front of her in stockings, reminding me of the color of bologna skins, and Billy lay beside her and</p>
      <p>put his head in her lap and let her tease at his ear with a dandelion [247] fluff. Billy was talking about</p>
      <p>looking for a wife and going to college someday. His mother tickled him with the fluff and laughed</p>
      <p>at such foolishness.</p>
      <p>“Sweetheart, you still have scads of time for things like that. Your whole life is ahead of you.”</p>
      <p>“Mother, I’m th-th-thirty-one years old!”</p>
      <p>She  laughed  and  twiddled  his  ear  with  the  weed.  “Sweetheart,  do  I  look  like  the  mother  of  a</p>
      <p>middle-aged man?”</p>
      <p>She wrinkled her nose and opened her lips at him and made a kind of wet kissing sound in the air</p>
      <p>with her tongue, and I had to admit she didn’t look like a mother of any kind. I didn’t believe myself</p>
      <p>that he could be thirty-one years old till later when I edged up close enough to act a look at the birth</p>
      <p>date on his wristband.</p>
      <p>At  midnight,  when  Geever  and  the  other  black  boy  and  the  nurse  went  off  duty,  and  the  old</p>
      <p>colored  fellow,  Mr.  Turkle,  came  on  for  his  shift,  McMurphy  and  Billy  were  already  up,  taking</p>
      <p>vitamins, I imagined. I got out of bed and put on a robe and walked out to the day room, where they</p>
      <p>were talking with Mr. Turkle. Harding and Scanlon and Sefelt and some of the other guys came out</p>
      <p>too. McMurphy was telling Mr. Turkle what to expect if the girl did come,—reminding him, actually,</p>
      <p>because it looked like they’d talked it all over beforehand a couple of weeks back. McMurphy said</p>
      <p>that the thing to do was let the girl in the window, instead of risking having her come through the</p>
      <p>lobby, where the night supervisor might be. And to unlock the Seclusion Room then. Yeah, won’t</p>
      <p>that  make  a  fine  honeymoon  shack  for  the  lovers?  Mighty  secluded.  (“Ahh,  McM-Murphy,”  Billy</p>
      <p>kept trying to say.) And to keep the lights out. So the supervisor couldn’t see in. And close the dorm</p>
      <p>doors and not wake up every slobbering Chronic in the place. And to keep quiet; we don’t want to</p>
      <p>disturb them.</p>
      <p>“Ah, come on, M-M-Mack,” Billy said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Turkle kept nodding and bobbing his head, appearing to fall half asleep. When McMurphy</p>
      <p>said,  “I  guess  that  pretty  well  covers  things,”  Mr. Turkle  said,  “No—not  en-tiuhly,”  and  sat  there</p>
      <p>grinning in his white suit with his bald yellow head floating at the end of his neck like a balloon on a</p>
      <p>stick.</p>
      <p>“Come on, Turkle. It’ll be worth your while. She should be bringin’ a couple of bottles.”</p>
      <p>“You gettin’ closer,” Mr. Turkle said. His head lolled and bobbled. He acted like he was barely</p>
      <p>able  to  keep  awake.  I’d  heard  he  worked  another  job  during  the  day,  at  a  race  track.  McMurphy</p>
      <p>turned to Billy.</p>
      <p>[248] “Turkle is holdin’ out for a bigger contract, Billy Boy. How much is it worth to you to lose</p>
      <p>your ol’ cherry?”</p>
      <p>Before  Billy  could  stop  stuttering  and  answer,  Mr.  Turkle  shook  his  head.  “It  ain’  that.  Not</p>
      <p>money. She bringin’ more than the bottle with her, though, ain’t she, this sweet thing? You people</p>
      <p>be sharing more’n a bottle, won’t you.” He grinned around at the faces.</p>
      <p>Billy nearly burst, trying to stutter something about not Candy, not his girl! McMurphy took him</p>
      <p>aside and told him not to worry about his girl’s chastity—Turkle’d likely be so drunk and sleepy by</p>
      <p>the time Billy was finished that the old coon couldn’t put a carrot in a washtub.</p>
      <p>The girl was late again. We sat out in the day room in our robes, listening to McMurphy and Mr.</p>
      <p>Turkle tell Army stories while they passed one of Mr. Turkle’s cigarettes back and forth, smoking it a</p>
      <p>funny way, holding the smoke in when they inhaled till their eyes bugged. Once Harding asked what</p>

      <p>manner of cigarette they were smoking that smelled so provocative, and Mr. Turkle said in a high,</p>
      <p>breath-holding voice, “Jus’ a plain old cigarette. Hee hoe, yes. You want a toke?”</p>
      <p>Billy got more and more nervous, afraid the girl might not show up, afraid she might. He kept</p>
      <p>asking why didn’t we all go to bed, instead off sitting out here in the cold dark like hounds waiting at</p>
      <p>the kitchen for table scraps, and we just grinned at him. None of us felt like going to bed; it wasn’t</p>
      <p>cold at all, and it was pleasant to relax in the half-light and listen to McMurphy and Mr. Turkle tell</p>
      <p>tales. Nobody acted sleepy, or not even very worried that it was after two o’clock and the girl hadn’t</p>
      <p>showed up yet. Turkle suggested maybe she was late because the ward was so dark she couldn’t see to</p>
      <p>tell which one to come to, and McMurphy said that was the obvious truth, so the two of them ran</p>
      <p>up  and  down  the  halls,  turning  on  every  light  in  the  place,  were  even  about  to  turn  on  the  big</p>
      <p>overhead wake-up lights in the dorm when Harding told them this would just get all the other men</p>
      <p>out  of  bed  to  share  things  with.  They  agreed  and  settled  for  all  the  lights  in  the  doctor’s  office</p>
      <p>instead.</p>
      <p>No  sooner  did  they  have  the  ward  lit  up  like  full  daylight  than  there  came  a  tapping  at  the</p>
      <p>window. McMurphy ran to the window and put his face to it, cupping his hands on, each side so he</p>
      <p>could see. He drew back and grinned at us.</p>
      <p>“She walks like beauty, in the night,” he said. He took Billy by the wrist and dragged him to the</p>
      <p>window. “Let her in, Turkle. Let this mad stud at her.”</p>
      <p>[249] “Look, McM-M-M-Murphy, wait.” Billy was balking like a mule.</p>
      <p>“Don’t you mamamamurphy me, Billy Boy. It’s too late to back out now. You’ll pull through. I’ll</p>
      <p>tell you what: I got five dollars here says you burn that woman down; all right? Open the window,</p>
      <p>Turkle.”</p>
      <p>There were two girls in the dark, Candy and the other one that hadn’t shown up for the fishing</p>
      <p>trip. “Hot dog,” Turkle said, helping them through, “enough for ever’body.”</p>
      <p>We  all  went  to  help:  they  had  to  lift  their  tight  skirts  up  to  their  thighs  to  step  through  the</p>
      <p>window. Candy said, “You damn McMurphy,” and tried so wild to throw her arms around him that</p>
      <p>she came near to breaking the bottles she held by the neck in each hand. She was weaving around</p>
      <p>quite a bit, and her hair was falling out of the hairdo she had piled on top of her head. I thought she</p>
      <p>looked  better  with  it  swung  at  the  back  like  she’d worn  it on the  fishing  trip.  She  gestured  at  the</p>
      <p>other girl with a bottle as she came through the window.</p>
      <p>“Sandy came along. She just up and left that maniac from Beaverton that she married; isn’t that</p>
      <p>wild?”</p>
      <p>The  girl  came  trough  the  window  and  kissed  McMurphy  and  said,  “Hello,  Mack.  I’m  sorry  I</p>
      <p>didn’t show up. But that’s over. You can take just so many funsies like white mice in your pillowcase</p>
      <p>and worms in your cold cream and frogs in your bra.” She shook her head once and wiped her hand</p>
      <p>in front of her like she was wiping away the memory of her animal-loving, husband. “Cheesus, what</p>
      <p>a maniac.”</p>
      <p>They  were  both  in  skirts  and  sweaters  and  nylons  and  barefoot,  and  both  red-cheeked  and</p>
      <p>giggling. “We had to keep asking for directions,” Candy explained, “at every bar we came to.</p>
      <p>Sandy was turning around in a big wide-eyed circle. “Whoee, Candy girl, what are we in now? Is</p>
      <p>this real? Are we in an asylum? Man!” She was bigger than Candy, and maybe five years older, and</p>
      <p>had tried to lock her bay-colored hair in a stylish bun at the back of her head, but it kept stringing</p>
      <p>down around her broad milk-fed cheekbones, and she looked like a cowgirl trying to pass herself off</p>
      <p>as a society lady. Her shoulders and breasts and hips were too wide and her grin too big and open</p>
      <p>for  her to  ever  be  called  beautiful,  but  she  was  pretty  and  she  was  healthy  and  she  had  one  long</p>
      <p>finger crooked in the ring of a gallon of red wine, and it swung at her side like a purse.</p>
      <p>“How, Candy, how, how, how do these wild things happen [250] to us?” She turned around once</p>
      <p>more and stopped, with her bare feet spread, giggling.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>164</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“These things don’t happen,” Harding said to the girl solemnly. “These things are fantasies you</p>
      <p>lie awake at night dreaming up and then are afraid to tell your analyst. You’re not really here. That</p>
      <p>wine isn’t real; none of this exists. Now, let’s go on from there.”</p>
      <p>“Hello, Billy,” Candy said.</p>
      <p>“Look at that stuff,” Turkle said.</p>
      <p>Candy straight-armed one of the bottles awkwardly toward Billy. “I brought you a present.”</p>
      <p>“These things are Thorne Smithian daydreams!” Harding said.</p>
      <p>“Boy!” the girl named Sandy said. “What have we got ourselves into?”</p>
      <p>“Shhhh,” Scanlon said and scowled around him. “You’ll wake up those other bastards, talking so</p>
      <p>loud.”</p>
      <p>“What’s the matter, stingy?” Sandy giggled, starting to turn in her circle again. “You scared there’s</p>
      <p>not enough to go around?”</p>
      <p>“Sandy, I mighta known you’d bring that damn cheap port.”</p>
      <p>“Boy!” She stopped her turning to look up at me. “Dig this one, Candy. A Goliath—fee, fi, fo,</p>
      <p>fum.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Turkle said, “Hot dog,” and locked the screen back, and Sandy said, “Boy,” again. We were</p>
      <p>all  in an awkward little cluster in the middle of the day room, shifting around one another, saying</p>
      <p>things just because nobody knew what else to do yet—never been up against a situation like it—and</p>
      <p>I don’t know when this excited, uneasy flurry of talk and giggling and shuffling around the day room</p>
      <p>would’ve stopped if that ward door hadn’t rung with a key knocking it open down the hall—jarred</p>
      <p>everybody like a burglar alarm going off.</p>
      <p>“Oh, Lord God,” Mr. Turkle said, clapping his hand on the top of his bald head, “it’s the soo-</p>
      <p>pervisor, come to fire my black ass.”</p>
      <p>We all ran into the latrine and turned out the light and stood in the dark, listening to one another</p>
      <p>breathe.  We could  hear that  supervisor  wander  around  the  ward,  calling  for  Mr.  Turkle  in  a  loud,</p>
      <p>half-afraid whisper. Her voice was soft and worried, rising at the end as she called, “Mr. Tur-kull?</p>
      <p>Mis-tur Turkle?”</p>
      <p>“Where the hell is he?” McMurphy whispered. “Why don’t he answer her?”</p>
      <p>“Don’t worry,” Scanlon said. “She won’t look in the can.”</p>
      <p>“But why don’t he answer? Maybe he got too high.”</p>
      <p>[251] “Man, what you talkin’? I don’t get too high, not on a little middlin’ joint like that one.” It</p>
      <p>was Mr. Turkle’s voice somewhere in the dark latrine with us.</p>
      <p>“Jesus, Turkle, what are you doing in here?” McMurphy was trying to sound stern and keep from</p>
      <p>laughing at the same time. “Get out there and see what she wants. What’ll she think if she doesn’t</p>
      <p>find you?”</p>
      <p>“The end is upon us,” Harding said and sat down. “Allah be merciful.”</p>
      <p>Turkle opened the door and slipped out and met her in the hall. She’d come over to see what all</p>
      <p>the lights were on about. What made it necessary to turn on every fixture in the ward? Turkle said</p>
      <p>every fixture wasn’t on; that the dorm lights were off and so were the ones in the latrine. She said</p>
      <p>that was no excuse for the other lights; what possible reason could there be for all this light? Turkle</p>
      <p>couldn’t come up with an answer for this, and during the long pause I heard the battle being passed</p>
      <p>around near me in the dark. Out in the hall she asked him again, and Turkle told her, well, he was</p>
      <p>just cleanin’ up, policing the areas. She wanted to know why, then, was the latrine, the place that his</p>
      <p>job  description  called  for  him  to  have  clean,  the  only  place  that  was  dark?  And  the  bottle  went</p>
      <p>around again while we waited to see what he’d answer. It came by me, and I took a drink. I felt I</p>
      <p>needed  it.  I  could  hear  Turkle  swallowing  all  the  way  out  in  the  hall,  umming  and  ahing  for</p>
      <p>something to say.</p>
      <p>“He’s skulled,” McMurphy hissed. “Somebody’s gonna have to go out and help him.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>165</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>I heard a toilet flush behind me, and the door opened and Harding was caught in the hall light as</p>
      <p>he went out, pulling up his pajamas. I heard the supervisor gasp at the sight of him and he told her</p>
      <p>to pardon him, but he hadn’t seen her, being as it was so dark.</p>
      <p>“It isn’t dark.”</p>
      <p>“In the latrine, I meant. I always switch off the lights to achieve a better bowel movement. Those</p>
      <p>mirrors, you understand; when the light is on the mirrors seem to be sitting in judgment over me to</p>
      <p>arbitrate a punishment if everything doesn’t come out right.”</p>
      <p>“But Aide Turkle said he was cleaning in there …”</p>
      <p>“And doing quite a good job, too, I might add—considering the restrictions imposed on him by</p>
      <p>the dark. Would you care to see?”</p>
      <p>Harding  pushed  the  door  open  a  crack,  and  a  slice  of  light  cut  across  the  latrine  floor  tile.  I</p>
      <p>caught a glimpse of the [252] supervisor backing off, saying she’d have to decline his offer but she</p>
      <p>had further rounds to make. I heard the ward door unlock again up the hall, and she let herself off</p>
      <p>the  ward.  Harding  called  to  her  to  return  soon  for  another  visit,  and  everybody  rushed  out  and</p>
      <p>shook his hand and pounded his back for the way he’d pulled it off.</p>
      <p>We stood there in the hall, and the wine went around again. Sefelt said he’d as  leave have that</p>
      <p>vodka if there was something to mix it with. He asked Mr. Turkle if there wasn’t something on the</p>
      <p>ward to put in it and Turkle said nothing but water. Fredrickson asked what about the cough sirup?</p>
      <p>“They give me a little now and then from a half-gallon jug in the drug room. It’s not bad tasting.</p>
      <p>You have a key for that room, Turkle?”</p>
      <p>Turkle  said  the  supervisor  was  the  only  one  on  nights  who  had  a  key  to  the  drug  room,  but</p>
      <p>McMurphy talked him into letting us have a try at picking the lock. Turkle grinned and nodded his</p>
      <p>head lazily. While he and McMurphy worked at the lock on the drug room with paper clips, the girls</p>
      <p>and the rest of us ran around in the Nurses’ Station opening files and reading records.</p>
      <p>“Look here,” Scanlon said, waving one of those folders. “Talk about complete. They’ve even got</p>
      <p>my first-grade report card in here. Aaah, miserable grades, just miserable.”</p>
      <p>Bill and his girl were going over his folder. She stepped back to look him over. “All these things,</p>
      <p>Billy? Phrenic this and pathic that? You don’t look like you have all these things.”</p>
      <p>The other girl had opened a supply drawer and was suspicious about what the nurses needed with</p>
      <p>all  those  hot-water  bottles,  a  million  of  ‘em,  and  Harding  was  sitting  on  the  Big  Nurse’s  desk,</p>
      <p>shaking his head at the whole affair.</p>
      <p>McMurphy  and Turkle  got  the  door of  the  drug  room  open  and  brought out  a  bottle  of  thick</p>
      <p>cherry-colored liquid from the ice box. McMurphy tipped the bottle to the light and read the label</p>
      <p>out loud.</p>
      <p>“Artificial flavor, coloring, citric acid. Seventy per cent inert materials—that must be water—and</p>
      <p>twenty  per  cent  alcohol—that’s  fine—and  ten  per  cent  codeine  Warning  Narcotic  May  Be  Habit</p>
      <p>Forming.” He unscrewed the bottle and took a taste of it, closing his eyes. He worked his tongue</p>
      <p>around his teeth and took another swallow and read the label again. “Well,” he said, and clicked his</p>
      <p>teeth together like they’d just been sharpened, “if we cut it a leetle bit with the vodka, I think it’ll be</p>
      <p>all right. How are we fixed for ice cubes, Turkey, old buddy?”</p>
      <p>[253] Mixed in paper medicine cups with the liquor and the port wine, the sirup had a taste like a</p>
      <p>kid’s drink but a punch like the cactus apple wine we used to get in The Dalles, cold and soothing on</p>
      <p>the throat and hot and furious once it got down. We turned out the lights in the day room and sat</p>
      <p>around  drinking  it.  We  threw  the  first  couple  of  cups  down  like  we  were  taking  our  medication,</p>
      <p>drinking  it  in  serious  and  silent  doses  and  looking  one  another  over  to  see  if  it  was  going  to  kill</p>
      <p>anybody. McMurphy and Turkle switched back and forth from the drink to Turkle’s cigarettes and</p>
      <p>got to giggling again as they discussed how it would be to lay that little nurse with the birthmark who</p>
      <p>went off, at midnight.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>166</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“I’d be scared,” Turkle said, “that she might go to whuppin’ me with that big of cross on that</p>
      <p>chain. Wun’t that be a fix to be in, now?”</p>
      <p>“I’d  be  scared,”  McMurphy  said,  “that  just  about  the  time  I  was  getting  my  jellies  she’d  reach</p>
      <p>around behind me with a thermometer and take my temperature!”</p>
      <p>That busted everybody up. Harding stopped laughing long enough to join the joking.</p>
      <p>“Or worse yet,” he said. “Just lie there under you with a dreadful concentration on her face, and</p>
      <p>tell you—oh Jesus, listen—tell you what your pulse was!”</p>
      <p>“Oh don’t ... oh my Gawd ...”</p>
      <p>“Or even worse, just lie there, and be able to calculate your pulse and temperature both—sans</p>
      <p>instruments!”</p>
      <p>“Oh Gawd, oh please don’t …”</p>
      <p>We laughed till we were rolling about the couches and chairs, choking and teary-eyed. The girls</p>
      <p>were so weak  from laughing they had to try two or three times to get to their feet. “I gotta ... go</p>
      <p>tinkle,”  the  big  one  said  and  went  weaving  and  giggling  toward  the  latrine  and  missed  the  door,</p>
      <p>staggered  into  the  dorm  while  we  all  hushed  one  another  with  fingers  to the  lips,  waiting,  till  she</p>
      <p>gave  a  squeal  and  we  heard  old  Colonel  Matterson  roar,  “The  pillow  is  …  a  horse!”—and  come</p>
      <p>whisking out of the dorm right behind her in his wheelchair.</p>
      <p>Sefelt wheeled the colonel back to the dorm and showed the girl where the latrine was personally,</p>
      <p>told her it was generally used by males only but he would stand at the door while she was in there</p>
      <p>and guard against intrusions on her privacy, defend it against all comers, by gosh. She thanked him</p>
      <p>solemnly and shook his hand and they saluted each other and while she was inside here came the</p>
      <p>colonel out of the dorm in his wheelchair again, and Sefelt had his hands full keeping him out of the</p>
      <p>latrine.  When  the  girl  came  out  of  the  door  he  was  trying  [254]  to  ward  off  the  charges  of  the</p>
      <p>wheelchair with his foot while we stood on the edge of the fracas cheering one guy or the other. The</p>
      <p>girl  helped  Sefelt put  the colonel  back  to bed,  and  then the  two  of them  went  down the  hall  and</p>
      <p>waltzed to music nobody could hear.</p>
      <p>Harding  drank  and  watched  and  shook  his  head.  “It  isn’t  happening.  It’s  all  a  collaboration of</p>
      <p>Kafka and Mark Twain and Martini.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy and Turkle got to worrying that there might still be too many lights, so they went up</p>
      <p>and down the hall turning out everything that glowed, even the little knee-high night lights, till the</p>
      <p>place  was  pitch  black.  Turkle  got  out  flashlights,  and  we  played  tag  up  and  down  the  hall  with</p>
      <p>wheelchairs from storage, having a big time till we heard one of Sefelt’s convulsion cries and went to</p>
      <p>find him sprawled twitching beside that big girl, Sandy. She was sitting on the floor brushing at her</p>
      <p>skirt, looking down at Sefelt. “I never experienced anything like it,” she said with quiet awe.</p>
      <p>Fredrickson knelt beside his friend and put a wallet between his teeth to keep him from chewing</p>
      <p>his tongue, and helped him get his pants buttoned. “You all right, Seef? Seef?”</p>
      <p>Sefelt didn’t open his eyes, but he raised a limp hand and picked the wallet out of his mouth. He</p>
      <p>grinned through his spit. “I’m all right,” he said. “Medicate me and turn me loose again.”</p>
      <p>You really need some medication, Seef?”</p>
      <p>“Medication.”</p>
      <p>“Medication,” Fredrickson said over his shoulder, still kneeling. “Medication,” Harding repeated</p>
      <p>and weaved off with his flashlight to the drug room. Sandy watched him go with glazed eyes. She</p>
      <p>was sitting beside Sefelt, stroking his head in wonderment.</p>
      <p>“Maybe  you  better  bring  me  something  too,”  she  called  drunkenly  after  Harding.  “I  never</p>
      <p>experienced anything to come even close to it.”</p>
      <p>Down  the hall  we  heard  glass  crash  and  Harding  came  back  with  a  double  handful  of pills;  he</p>
      <p>sprinkled them over Sefelt and the woman like he was crumbling clods into a grave. He raised his</p>
      <p>eyes toward the ceiling.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>167</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Most merciful God, accept these two poor sinners into your arms. And keep the doors ajar for</p>
      <p>the coming of the rest of us, because you are witnessing the end, the absolute, irrevocable, fantastic</p>
      <p>end.  I’ve  finally  realized  what  is  happening.  It  is  our  last  fling.  We  are  doomed  henceforth.  Must</p>
      <p>screw our courage to the sticking point and face up to our impending fate. We [255] shall be all of us</p>
      <p>shot at dawn. One hundred cc’s apiece. Miss Ratched shall line us all  against the wall, where we,,,</p>
      <p>face the terrible maw of a muzzle-loading shotgun which she has loaded with Miltowns! Thorazines!</p>
      <p>Libriums! Stelazines! And with a wave of her sword, blooie! Tranquilize all of us completely out of</p>
      <p>existence.”</p>
      <p>He sagged against the wall and slid to the floor, pills hopping out of his hands in all directions</p>
      <p>like red and green and orange bugs. “Amen,” he said and closed his eyes.</p>
      <p>The  girl  on the  floor  smoothed  down her  skirt  over  her  long  hard-working  legs  and  looked  at</p>
      <p>Sefelt  still  grinning  and  twitching  there  under  the  lights  beside  her,  and  said,  “Never  in  my  life</p>
      <p>experienced anything to come even halfway near it.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>Harding’s  speech,  if  it  hadn’t  actually  sobered  people,  had  at  least  made  them  realize  the</p>
      <p>seriousness of what we were doing. The night was getting on, and some thought had to be given to</p>
      <p>the  arrival  of  the  staff  in  the  morning.  Billy  Bibbit  and  his  girl  mentioned  that  it  was  after  four</p>
      <p>o’clock  and,  if  it  was  all  right,  if  people  didn’t  mind,  they’d  like  to  have  Mr.  Turkle  unlock  the</p>
      <p>Seclusion Room. They went off under an arch of flashlight beams, and the rest of us went into the</p>
      <p>day room to see what we could decide about cleaning up. Turkle was all but passed out when he got</p>
      <p>back from Seclusion, and we had to push him into the day room in a wheel chair.</p>
      <p>As  I  walked  after  them  it  came  to  me  as  a  kind  of  sudden  surprise  that  I  was  drunk,  actually</p>
      <p>drunk,  glowing  and  grinning  and  staggering  drunk  for  the  first  time  since  the  Army,  drunk  along</p>
      <p>with  half  a  dozen  other  guys  and  a  couple  of  girls—right  on  the  Big  Nurse’s  ward!  Drunk  and</p>
      <p>running  and  laughing  and  carrying  on  with  women  square  in  the  center  of  the  Combine’s  most</p>
      <p>powerful  stronghold!  I  thought  back  on  the  night,  on  what  we’d  been  doing,  and  it  was  near</p>
      <p>impossible to believe. I had to keep reminding myself that it had truly happened, that we had made it</p>
      <p>happen. We had just unlocked a window and let it in like you let in the fresh air. Maybe the Combine</p>
      <p>wasn’t all-powerful. What was to stop us from doing it again, now that we saw we could? Or keep us</p>
      <p>from doing other things we wanted? I felt so good thinking about this that I gave a yell and swooped</p>
      <p>down on McMurphy and the girl Sandy walking along in front of me, grabbed them both up, one in</p>
      <p>each arm, and ran all the way to the day room with them hollering and kicking like kids. I felt that</p>
      <p>good.</p>
      <p>Colonel Matterson got up again, bright-eyed and full of lessons, and Scanlon wheeled him back</p>
      <p>to bed. Sefelt and [256] Martini and Fredrickson said they’d better hit the sack too. McMurphy and I</p>
      <p>and Harding and the girl and Mr. Turkle stayed up to finish off the cough sirup and decide what we</p>
      <p>were going to do about the mess the ward was in. Me and Harding acted like we were the only ones</p>
      <p>really  very  worried-  about  it;  McMurphy  and  the  big  girl  just  sat  there  and  sipped  that  sirup  and</p>
      <p>grinned at each other and played hand games in the shadows, and Mr. Turkle kept dropping off to</p>
      <p>sleep. Harding did his best to try to get them concerned.</p>
      <p>“All of you fail to compren’ the complexities of the situation,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Bull,” McMurphy said.</p>
      <p>Harding  slapped  the  table.  “McMurphy,  Turkle,  you  fail  to  realize  what  has  occurred  here</p>
      <p>tonight. On a mental ward. Miss Ratched’s ward! The reekerputions will be ... devastating!”</p>
      <p>McMurphy bit the girl’s ear lobe. Turkle nodded and opened one eye and said, “Tha’s true. She’ll</p>
      <p>be on tomorrow, too.”</p>
      <p>“I, however, have a plan,” Harding said. He got to his feet. He said McMurphy was obviously too</p>
      <p>far gone to handle the situation himself and someone else would have to take over. As he talked he</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>168</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>stood  straighter  and became  more  sober.  He  spoke  in  an earnest  and  urgent  voice,  and his  hands</p>
      <p>shaped what he said. I was glad he was there to take over.</p>
      <p>His plan was that we were to tie up Turkle and make it look like McMurphy’d snuck up behind</p>
      <p>him, tied him up with oh, say, strips of torn sheet, and relieved him of his keys, and after getting the</p>
      <p>keys  had  broken  into the  drug  room,  scattered  drugs  around,  and  raised  hell  with  the  files  just  to</p>
      <p>spite the nurse—she’d believe that part—then he’d unlocked the screen and made his escape.</p>
      <p>McMurphy said it sounded like a television plot and it was so ridiculous it couldn’t help but work,</p>
      <p>and  he  complimented  Harding  on  his  clear-headedness.  Harding  said  the  plan  had  its  merits;  it</p>
      <p>would  keep  the  other  guys  out  of  trouble  with  the  nurse,  and  keep  Turkle  his  job,  and  get</p>
      <p>McMurphy off the ward. He said McMurphy could have the girls drive him to Canada or Tiajuana,</p>
      <p>or  even Nevada  if  he  wanted,  and be  completely  safe;  the police  never press  too hard  to pick  up</p>
      <p>AWOLs from the hospital because ninety per cent of them always show back up in a few days, broke</p>
      <p>and drunk and looking for that free bed and board. We talked about it for a while and finished the</p>
      <p>cough sirup. We finally talked it to silence. Harding sat back down.</p>
      <p>McMurphy  took  his  arm  from  around  the  girl  and  looked  from  me  to  Harding,  thinking,  that</p>
      <p>strange, tired expression [257] on his face again. He asked what about us, why didn’t we just up and</p>
      <p>get our clothes on and make it out with him?</p>
      <p>“I’m not quite ready yet, Mack,” Harding told him.</p>
      <p>“Then what makes you think I am?”</p>
      <p>Harding looked at him in silence for a time and smiled, then said, “No, you don’t understand. I’ll</p>
      <p>be ready in a few weeks. But I want to do it on my own, by myself, right out that front door, with all</p>
      <p>the traditional red tape and complications. I want my wife to be here in a car at a certain time to pick</p>
      <p>me up. I want them to know I was able to do it that way.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy nodded. “What about you, Chief?”</p>
      <p>“I figure I’m all right. Just I don’t know where I want to go yet. And somebody should stay here</p>
      <p>a few weeks after you’re gone to see that things don’t start sliding back.”</p>
      <p>“What about Billy and Sefelt and Fredrickson and the rest?”</p>
      <p>“I  can’t  speak  for  them,”  Harding  said.  “They’ve  still  got  their  problems,  just  like  all  of  us.</p>
      <p>They’re  still  sick  men  in  lots  of  ways.  But  at  least  there’s  that:  they  are  sick  men  now.  No  more</p>
      <p>rabbits, Mack. Maybe they can be well men someday. I can’t say.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy thought this over, looking at the backs of his hands. He looked back up to Harding.</p>
      <p>“Harding, what is it? What happens?”</p>
      <p>“You mean all this?”</p>
      <p>McMurphy nodded.</p>
      <p>Harding shook his head. “I don’t think I can give you an answer. Oh, I could give you Freudian</p>
      <p>reasons with fancy talk, and that would be right as far as it went. But what you want are the reasons</p>
      <p>for the reasons, and I’m not able to give you those. Not for the others, anyway. For myself? Guilt.</p>
      <p>Shame.  Fear.  Self-belittlement.  I  discovered  at  an  early  age  that  I  was—shall  we  be  kind  and  say</p>
      <p>different? It’s a better, more general word than the other one. I indulged in certain practices that our</p>
      <p>society regards as shameful. And I got sick. It wasn’t the practices, I don’t think, it was the feeling</p>
      <p>that  the  great,  deadly,  pointing  forefinger  of  society  was  pointing  at  me—and  the  great  voice  of</p>
      <p>millions chanting, ‘Shame. Shame. Shame.’ It’s society’s way of dealing with someone different.”</p>
      <p>“I’m different,” McMurphy said. “Why didn’t something like that happen to me? I’ve had people</p>
      <p>bugging me about one thing or another as far back as I can remember but that’s not what—but it</p>
      <p>didn’t drive me crazy.”</p>
      <p>“No, you’re right. That’s not what drove you crazy. I wasn’t giving my reason as the sole reason.</p>
      <p>Though  I  used  to  think  at  [258]  one  time,  a  few  years  ago,  my  turtleneck  years,  that  society’s</p>
      <p>chastising  was  the  sole  force  that  drove one  along the road to  crazy, but  you’ve  caused  me to re-</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>169</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>appraise  my  theory.  There’s  something  else  that  drives  people,  strong  people  like  you,  my  friend,</p>
      <p>down that road.”</p>
      <p>“Yeah? Not that I’m admitting I’m down that road, but what is this something else?”</p>
      <p>“It is us.” He swept his hand about him in a soft white circle and repeated, “Us.”</p>
      <p>McMurphy halfheartedly said, “Bull,” and grinned and stood up, pulling the girl to her feet. He</p>
      <p>squinted up at the dim clock. “It’s nearly five. I need me a little shut-eye before my big getaway. The</p>
      <p>day shift doesn’t come on for another two hours yet; let’s leave Billy and Candy down there a while</p>
      <p>longer. I’ll cut out about six. Sandy, honey, maybe an hour in the dorm would sober us up. What do</p>
      <p>you say? We got a long drive tomorrow, whether it’s Canada or Mexico or wherever.”</p>
      <p>Turkle  and  Harding  and  I  stood  up  too.  Everybody  was  still  weaving  pretty  much,  still  pretty</p>
      <p>drunk, but a mellow, sad feeling, had drifted over the drunk. Turkle said he’d boot McMurphy and</p>
      <p>the girl out of bed in an hour.</p>
      <p>“Wake me up too,” Harding said. “I’d like to stand there at the window with a silver bullet in my</p>
      <p>hand and ask ‘Who wawz that’er masked man?’ as you ride—”</p>
      <p>“The hell with that. You guys both get in bed, and I don’t want to ever see hide nor hair of you</p>
      <p>again. You get me?”</p>
      <p>Harding  grinned  and  nodded  but  he  didn’t  say  anything.  McMurphy  put  his  hand  out,  and</p>
      <p>Harding shook it. McMurphy tipped back like a cowboy reeling out of a saloon and winked.</p>
      <p>“You can be bull goose loony again, buddy, what with Big Mack outa the way.”</p>
      <p>He turned to me and frowned. “I don’t know what you can be, Chief. You still got some looking</p>
      <p>to do. Maybe you could get you a job being the bad guy on TV rasslin’. Anyway, take ‘er easy.”</p>
      <p>I shook his hand, and we all started for the dorm. McMurphy told Turkle to tear up some sheets</p>
      <p>and pick out some of his favorite knots to be tied with. Turkle said he would. I got into my bed in</p>
      <p>the graying light of the dorm and heard McMurphy and the girl get into his bed. I was feeling numb</p>
      <p>and warm. I heard Mr. Turkle open the door to the linen room out in the hall, heave a long, loud,</p>
      <p>belching sigh as he pulled the door closed behind him. My eyes got used to the dark, and I could see</p>
      <p>McMurphy  and  the  girl  snuggled  into  each other’s [259]  shoulders,  getting  comfortable, more  like</p>
      <p>two tired little kids than a grown man and a grown woman in bed together to make love.</p>
      <p>And that’s the way the black boys found them when they came to turn on the dorm lights at six-</p>
      <p>thirty.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>170</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>29</p>
      <p>I‘ve given what happened next a good lot of thought, and I’ve come around to thinking that it</p>
      <p>was bound to be and would have happened in one way or another, at this time or that, even if Mr.</p>
      <p>Turkle had got McMurphy and the two girls up and off the ward like was planned. The Big Nurse</p>
      <p>would have found out some way what had gone on, maybe just by the look on Billy’s face, and she’d</p>
      <p>have done the same as she did whether McMurphy was still around or not. And Billy would have</p>
      <p>done what he did, and McMurphy would have heard about it and come back.</p>
      <p>Would have had to come back, because he could no more have sat around outside the hospital,</p>
      <p>playing poker in Carson‘ City or Reno or someplace, and let the Big Nurse have the last move and</p>
      <p>get the last play, than he could have let her get by with it right under his nose. It was like he’d signed</p>
      <p>on for the whole game and there wasn’t any way of him breaking his contract.</p>
      <p>As soon as we started getting out of bed and circulating around the ward, the story of what had</p>
      <p>taken place was spreading in a brush fire of low talk. “They had a what?” asked the ones who hadn’t</p>
      <p>been in on it. “A whore? In the dorm? Jesus.” Not only a whore, the others told them, but a drunken</p>
      <p>blast to boot. McMurphy was planning to sneak her out before the day crew came on but he didn’t</p>
      <p>wake up. “Now what kind of crock are you giving us?” “No crock. It’s every word gospel. I was in</p>
      <p>on it.”</p>
      <p>Those  who  had  been  in  on  the  night  started  telling  about  it  with  a  kind  of  quiet  pride  and</p>
      <p>wonder,  the  way  people  tell  about  seeing  a  big  hotel  fire  or  a  dam  bursting—very  solemn  and</p>
      <p>respectful because the casualties aren’t even counted yet—but the longer the telling went on, the less</p>
      <p>solemn the fellows got. Everytime the Big Nurse and her hustling black boys turned up something</p>
      <p>new, such as the empty bottle of cough syrup or the fleet of wheelchairs parked at the end of the</p>
      <p>hall like empty rides in an amusement park, it brought another part of the night back sudden and</p>
      <p>clear to be told to the guys who weren’t in on it and to be savored by the guys who were. Everybody</p>
      <p>had  been  herded  into  the  day  room  by  the  [261]  black  boys,  Chronics  and  Acutes  alike,  milling</p>
      <p>together in excited confusion. The two old Vegetables sat sunk in their bedding, snapping their eyes</p>
      <p>and their gums. Everybody was still in pajamas and slippers except McMurphy and the girl; she was</p>
      <p>dressed, except for her shoes and the nylon stockings, which now hung over her shoulder, and he</p>
      <p>was in his black shorts with the white whales. They were sitting together on a sofa, holding hands.</p>
      <p>The girl had dozed off again, and McMurphy was leaning against her with a satisfied and sleepy grin.</p>
      <p>Our solemn worry was giving way, in spite of us, to joy and humor. When the nurse found the</p>
      <p>pile of pills Harding had sprinkled on Sefelt and the girl, we started to pop and snort to keep from</p>
      <p>laughing,  and  by  the  time  they  found  Mr. Turkle  in  the  linen  room  and  led him  out blinking  and</p>
      <p>groaning, tangled in a hundred yards of torn sheet like a mummy with a hangover, we were roaring.</p>
      <p>The  Big  Nurse  took  our  good humor  without  so much  as  a  trace  of her  little pasted  smile;  every</p>
      <p>laugh  was  being  forced  right  down  her  throat  till  it  looked  as  if  any  minute  she’d  blow  up  like  a</p>
      <p>bladder.</p>
      <p>McMurphy  draped one  bare  leg  over the  edge  of  the  sofa nd  pulled  his  cap  down to  keep the</p>
      <p>light from hurting his reddened eyes, and he kept licking out a tongue that looked like it had been</p>
      <p>shellacked by that cough syrup. He looked sick and terrifically tired, and he kept pressing the heels</p>
      <p>of his hands against his temples and yawning, but as bad as he seemed to feel he still held his grin</p>
      <p>and once or twice went so far as to laugh out loud at some of the things the nurse kept turning up.</p>
      <p>When the nurse went in to call the Main Building to report Mr. Turkle’s resignation, Turkle and</p>
      <p>the  girl  Sandy  took  the  opportunity  to  unlock  that  screen  again  and  wave  good-by  to  all  and  go</p>
      <p>loping off across the grounds, stumbling and slipping on the wet, sun-sparkle grass.</p>
      <p>“He didn’t lock it back up,” Harding said to McMurphy. “Go on. Go on after them!”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>171</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>McMurphy groaned and opened one eye bloody as a hatching egg. “You kidding me? I couldn’t</p>
      <p>even get my head through that window, let alone my whole body.”</p>
      <p>“My friend, I don’t believe you fully comprehend—”</p>
      <p>“Harding, goddam you and your big words; all I fully comprehend this morning is I’m still half</p>
      <p>drunk.  And  sick.  Matter  of  fact, I  think  you’re  still  drunk  too.  Chief, how  about  you;  are  you  still</p>
      <p>drunk?”</p>
      <p>I said that my nose and cheeks didn’t have any feeling in them yet, if this could be taken to mean</p>
      <p>anything.</p>
      <p>[262] McMurphy nodded once and closed his eyes again; he laced his hands across his chest and</p>
      <p>slid down in his chair, his chin settling into his collar. He smacked his lips and smiled as if he were</p>
      <p>napping. “Man,” he said, “everybody is still drunk.”</p>
      <p>Harding was still concerned. He kept on about how the best thing for McMurphy to do was get</p>
      <p>dressed,  quickly,  while  old  Angel  of  Mercy  was  in  there  calling  the  doctor  again  to  report  the</p>
      <p>atrocities she had uncovered, but McMurphy maintained that there wasn’t anything to get so excited</p>
      <p>about; he wasn’t any worse off than before, was he? “I’ve took their best punch,” he said. Harding</p>
      <p>threw up his hands and went off, predicting doom.</p>
      <p>One  of  the  black  boys  saw  the  screen  was  unlocked  and  locked  it  and  went  into  the  Nurses’</p>
      <p>Station for the big flat ledger, came back out running his finger down the roll and lipping the names</p>
      <p>he read out loud as he sighted the men that matched up with them. The roll is listed alphabetically</p>
      <p>backwards to throw people off, so he didn’t get to the Bs till right at the last. He looked around the</p>
      <p>day room without taking his finger from that last name in the ledger.</p>
      <p>“Bibbit. Where’s Billy Bibbit?” His eyes were big. He was thinking Billy’d slipped out right under</p>
      <p>his nose and would he ever catch it. “Who saw Billy Bibbit go, you damn goons?”</p>
      <p>This set people to remembering just where Billy was; there were whispers and laughing again.</p>
      <p>The  black  boy  went  back  into  the  station,  and  we saw  him  telling  the  nurse.  She  smashed  the</p>
      <p>phone down in the cradle and came out the door with the black boy hot after her; a lock of her hair</p>
      <p>had  broken  loose  from  beneath  her  white  cap  and  fell  across  her  face  like  wet  ashes.  She  was</p>
      <p>sweating between her eyebrows and under her nose. She demanded we tell her where the Eloper had</p>
      <p>gone. She was answered with a chorus of laughter, and her eyes went around the men.</p>
      <p>“So?  He’s  not  gone,  is  he?  Harding,  he’s  still  here—on  the  ward,  isn’t  he?  Tell  me.  Sefelt,  tell</p>
      <p>me!”</p>
      <p>She darted the eyes out with every word, stabbing at the men’s faces, but the men were immune</p>
      <p>to her poison. Their eyes met hers; their grins mocked the old confident smile she had lost.</p>
      <p>“Washington! Warren! Come with me for room check.”</p>
      <p>We  rose  and  followed  as  the  three  of  them  went  along,  unlocking  the  lab,  the  tub  room,  the</p>
      <p>doctor’s office. ... Scanlon covered his grin with his knotty hand and whispered, “Hey, ain’t it gonna</p>
      <p>be some joke on of Billy.” We all nodded. “And [263] Billy’s not the only one it’s gonna be a joke</p>
      <p>on, now that I think about it; remember who’s in there?”</p>
      <p>The nurse reached the door of the Seclusion Room at the end of the hall. We pushed up close to</p>
      <p>see, crowding and craning to peep over the Big Nurse and the two black boys as she unlocked it and</p>
      <p>swung it open. It was dark in the windowless room. There was a squeak and a scuffle in the dark,</p>
      <p>and the nurse reached out, flicked the light down on Billy and the girl where they were blinking up</p>
      <p>from that mattress on the floor like two owls from a nest. The nurse ignored the howl of laughter</p>
      <p>behind her.</p>
      <p>“William Bibbit!” She tried so hard to sound cold and stern. “William ... Bibbit!”</p>
      <p>“Good morning, Miss Ratched,” Billy said, not even making any move to get up and button his</p>
      <p>pajamas. He took the girl’s hand in his and grinned. “This is Candy.”</p>
      <p>The nurse’s tongue clucked in her bony throat. “Oh, Billy Billy Billy—I’m so ashamed for you.”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>172</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>Billy  wasn’t  awake  enough  to  respond  much  to  her  shaming,  and  the  girl  was  fussing  around</p>
      <p>looking  under  the  mattress  for  her  nylons,  moving  slow  and  warm-looking  after  sleep.  Every  so</p>
      <p>often  she  would  stop  her  dreamy  fumbling  and  look  up  and  smile  at  the  icy  figure  of  the  nurse</p>
      <p>standing there with her arms crossed, then feel to see if her sweater was buttoned, and go back to</p>
      <p>tugging for her nylon caught between the mattress and the tile floor. They both moved like fat cats</p>
      <p>full of warm milk, lazy in the sun: I guessed they were still fairly drunk too.</p>
      <p>“Oh,  Billy,”  the  nurse  said,  like  she  was  so  disappointed  she  might  break  down  and  cry.  “A</p>
      <p>woman like this. A cheap! Low! Painted—”</p>
      <p>“Courtesan?” Harding suggested. “Jezebel?” The nurse turned and tried to nail him with her eyes,</p>
      <p>but he just went on. “Not Jezebel? No?” He scratched his head in thought. “How about Salome?</p>
      <p>She’s notoriously evil. Perhaps ‘dame’ is the word you want. Well, I’m just trying to help.”</p>
      <p>She swung back to Billy. He was concentrating on getting to his feet. He rolled over and came to</p>
      <p>his knees, butt in the air like a cow getting up, then pushed up on his hands, then came to one foot,</p>
      <p>then the other, and straightened. He looked pleased with his success, as if he wasn’t even aware of</p>
      <p>us crowding at the door teasing him and hoorahing him.</p>
      <p>The  loud talk  and  laughter  swirled  around  the nurse.  She  looked  from Billy  and  the  girl  to  the</p>
      <p>bunch  of  us  behind  her.  The  enamel-and-plastic  face  was  caving  in.  She  shut  her  eyes  [264]  and</p>
      <p>strained to calm her trembling, concentrating. She knew this was it, her back to the wall. When her</p>
      <p>eyes opened again, they were very small and still.</p>
      <p>“What  worries  me,  Billy,”  she  said—I  could  hear  the  change  in  her  voice—”is  how  your  poor</p>
      <p>mother is going to take this.”</p>
      <p>She got the response she was after. Billy flinched and put his hand to his cheek like he’d been</p>
      <p>burned with acid.</p>
      <p>“Mrs. Bibbit’s always been so proud of your discretion. I know she has. This is going to disturb</p>
      <p>her terribly. You know how she is when she gets disturbed, Billy; you know how ill the poor woman</p>
      <p>can  become.  She’s  very  sensitive.  Especially  concerning  her  son.  She  always  spoke  so  proudly  of</p>
      <p>you. She al—”</p>
      <p>“Nuh! Nuh!” His mouth was working. He shook his head, begging her. “You d-don’t n-n-need!”</p>
      <p>“Billy Billy Billy,” she said. “Your mother and I are old friends.”</p>
      <p>“No!” he cried. His voice scraped the white, bare walls of the Seclusion Room. He lifted his chin</p>
      <p>so he was shouting at the moon of light in the ceiling. “N-n-no!”</p>
      <p>We’d stopped laughing. We watched Billy folding into the floor, head going back, knees coming</p>
      <p>forward. He rubbed his hand up and down that green pant leg. He was shaking his head in panic like</p>
      <p>a kid that’s been promised a whipping just as soon as a willow is cut. The nurse touched his shoulder</p>
      <p>to comfort him. The touch shook him like a blow.</p>
      <p>“Billy, I don’t want her to believe something like this of you—but what am I to think?”</p>
      <p>“Duh-duh-don’t t-tell, M-M-M-Miss Ratched. Duh-duh-duh—”</p>
      <p>“Billy,  I  have  to  tell.  I  hate  to  believe  you  would  behave  like  this,  but,  really,  what  else  can  I</p>
      <p>think? I find you alone, on a mattress, with this sort of woman.”</p>
      <p>“No! I d-d-didn’t. I was—” His hand went to his cheek again and stuck there. “She did.”</p>
      <p>“Billy, this girl could not have pulled you in here forcibly.” She shook her head. “Understand, I</p>
      <p>would like to believe something else—for your poor mother’s sake.”</p>
      <p>The  hand pulled  down  his  cheek,  raking  long  red  marks.  “She  d-did.”  He  looked  around  him.</p>
      <p>“And  M-M-McMurphy!  He  did.  And  Harding!  And  the-the-the  rest!  They t-t-teased  me, called  me</p>
      <p>things!”</p>
      <p>Now  his  face  was  fastened  to  hers.  He  didn’t  look  to  one  side  or  the  other,  but  only  straight</p>
      <p>ahead at her face, like there was a spiraling light there instead of features, a hypnotizing [265] swirl of</p>
      <p>cream  white  and  blue  and  orange.  He  swallowed  and  waited  for  her  to  say  something,  but  she</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>173</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>wouldn’t; her skill, her fantastic mechanical power flooded back into her, analyzing the situation and</p>
      <p>reporting to her that all she had to do was keep quiet.</p>
      <p>“They m-m-made me! Please, M-Miss Ratched, they may-may-MAY-!”</p>
      <p>She checked her beam, and Billy’s face pitched downward, sobbing with relief. She put a hand on</p>
      <p>his neck and drew his cheek to her starched breast, stroking his shoulder while she turned a slow,</p>
      <p>contemptuous look across the bunch of us.</p>
      <p>“It’s all right, Billy. It’s all right. No one else is going to harm you. It’s all right. I’ll explain to your</p>
      <p>mother.”</p>
      <p>She continued to glare at us as she spoke. It was strange to hear that voice, soft and soothing and</p>
      <p>warm as a pillow, coming out of a face hard as porcelain.</p>
      <p>“All right, Billy. Come along with me. You can wait over here in the doctor’s office. There’s no</p>
      <p>reason for you to be submitted to sitting out in the day room with these ... friends of yours.”</p>
      <p>She  led  him  into  the  office,  stroking  his  bowed  head  and  saying,  “Poor  boy,  poor  little  boy,”</p>
      <p>while  we  faded  back  down the  hall  silently  and  sat  down  in  the  day room  without  looking  at one</p>
      <p>another or speaking. McMurphy was the last one to take a seat.</p>
      <p>The  Chronics  across  the  way  had  stopped  milling  around  and  were  settling  into  their  slots.  I</p>
      <p>looked at McMurphy out of the corner of my eye, trying not to be obvious about it. He was in his</p>
      <p>chair in the corner, resting a second before he came out for the next round—in a long line of next</p>
      <p>rounds.  The  thing  he  was  fighting,  you  couldn’t  whip  it  for  good.  All  you  could  do  was  keep  on</p>
      <p>whipping it, till you couldn’t come out any more and somebody else had to take your place.</p>
      <p>There was more phoning going on in the Nurses’ Station and a number of authorities showing up</p>
      <p>for a tour of the evidence. When the doctor himself finally came in, every one of these people gave</p>
      <p>him a look like the whole thing had been planned by him, or at least condoned and authorized. He</p>
      <p>was  white  and  shaky  under  their  eyes.  You  could  see  he’d  already  heard  about  most  of  what  had</p>
      <p>gone on here, on his ward, but the Big Nurse outlined it for him again, in slow, loud details so we</p>
      <p>could hear it too. Hear it in the proper way, this time, solemnly, with no whispering or giggling while</p>
      <p>she talked. The doctor nodded and fiddled with his glasses, batting eyes so watery I thought he must</p>
      <p>be splashing her. She finished by [266] telling him about Billy and the tragic experience we had put</p>
      <p>the poor boy through.</p>
      <p>“I left him in your office. Judging from his present state, I suggest you see him right away. He’s</p>
      <p>been through a terrible ordeal. I shudder to think of the damage that must have been done to the</p>
      <p>poor boy.”</p>
      <p>She waited until the doctor shuddered too.</p>
      <p>“I  think  you  should  go  see  if  you  can  speak  with  him.  He  needs  a  lot  of  sympathy.  He’s  in  a</p>
      <p>pitiful state.”</p>
      <p>The doctor nodded again and walked off toward his office. We watched him go.</p>
      <p>“Mack,” Scanlon said. “Listen—you don’t think any of us are being taken in by this crap, do you?</p>
      <p>It’s bad, but we know where the blame lies—we ain’t blaming you.”</p>
      <p>“No,” I said, “none of us blame you.” And wished I’d had my tongue pulled out as soon as I saw</p>
      <p>the way he looked at me.</p>
      <p>He closed his eyes and relaxed. Waiting, it looked like. Harding got up and walked over to him</p>
      <p>and had just opened his mouth to say something when the doctor’s voice screaming down the hall</p>
      <p>smashed a common horror and realization onto everybody’s face.</p>
      <p>“Nurse!” he yelled. “Good lord, nurse!”</p>
      <p>She ran, and the three black boys ran, down the hall to where the doctor was still calling. But not</p>
      <p>a patient got up. We knew there wasn’t anything for us to do now but just sit tight and wait for her</p>
      <p>to come to the day room to tell us what we all had known was one of the things that was bound to</p>
      <p>happen.</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>174</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>She walked straight to McMurphy.</p>
      <p>“He cut his throat,” she said. She waited, hoping he would say something. He wouldn’t look up.</p>
      <p>“He opened the doctor’s desk and found some instruments and cut his throat. The poor miserable,</p>
      <p>misunderstood boy killed himself. He’s there now, in the doctor’s chair, with his throat cut.”</p>
      <p>She waited again. But he still wouldn’t look up.</p>
      <p>“First  Charles  Cheswick  and  now  William  Bibbit!  I  hope  you’re  finally  satisfied.  Playing  with</p>
      <p>human lives—gambling with human lives—as if you thought yourself to be a God!”</p>
      <p>She turned and walked into the Nurses’ Station and closed the door behind her, leaving a shrill,</p>
      <p>killing-cold sound ringing in the tubes of light over our heads.</p>
      <p>First I had a quick thought to try to stop him, talk him into taking what he’d already won and let</p>
      <p>her  have  the  last  round,  but  another,  bigger  thought  wiped  the  first  thought  away  completely.  I</p>
      <p>suddenly realized with a crystal certainty that [267]  neither I nor any of the half-score of us could</p>
      <p>stop  him.  That  Harding’s  arguing  or  my  grabbing  him  from  behind,  or  old  Colonel  Matterson’s</p>
      <p>teaching or Scanlon’s griping, or all of us together couldn’t rise up and stop him.</p>
      <p>We couldn’t stop him because we were the ones making him do it. It wasn’t the nurse that was</p>
      <p>forcing him, it was our need that was making him push himself slowly up from sitting, his big hands</p>
      <p>driving  down  on  the  leather  chair  arms,  pushing  him  up,  rising  and  standing  like  one  of  those</p>
      <p>moving-picture zombies, obeying orders beamed at him from forty masters. It was us that had been</p>
      <p>making him go on for weeks, keeping him standing long after his feet and legs had given out, weeks</p>
      <p>of  making  him  wink  and  grin  and  laugh  and  go  on  with  his  act  long  after  his  humor  had  been</p>
      <p>parched dry between two electrodes.</p>
      <p>We made him stand and hitch up his black shorts like they were horsehide chaps, and push back</p>
      <p>his  cap  with  one  finger  like  it  was  a  ten-gallon  Stetson,  slow,  mechanical  gestures—and  when  he</p>
      <p>walked across the floor you could hear the iron in his bare heels ring sparks out of the tile.</p>
      <p>Only  at  the  last—after  he’d  smashed  through  that  glass  door,  her  face  swinging  around,  with</p>
      <p>terror forever ruining any other look she might ever try to use again, screaming when he grabbed for</p>
      <p>her  and  ripped  her  uniform  all  the  way  down  the  front,  screaming  again  when  the  two  nippled</p>
      <p>circles started from her chest and swelled out and out, bigger than anybody had ever even imagined,</p>
      <p>warm  and  pink  in  the  light—only  at  the  last,  after  the  officials  realized  that  the  three  black  boys</p>
      <p>weren’t going to do anything but stand and watch and they would have to beat him off without their</p>
      <p>help, doctors and supervisors and nurses prying those heavy red fingers out of the white flesh of her</p>
      <p>throat as if they were her neck bones, jerking him backward off of her with a loud heave of breath,</p>
      <p>only  then  did  he  show  any  sign  that he might be  anything  other  than  a  sane,  willful,  dogged  man</p>
      <p>performing a hard duty that finally just had to be done, like it or not.</p>
      <p>He gave a cry. At the last, falling backward, his face appearing to us for a second upside down</p>
      <p>before he was smothered on the floor by a pile of white uniforms, he let himself cry out:</p>
      <p>A sound of cornered-animal fear and hate and surrender d defiance, that if you ever trailed coon</p>
      <p>or cougar or lynx is ;like the last sound the treed and shot and falling animal makes as the dogs get</p>
      <p>him, when he finally doesn’t care any more about anything but himself and his dying.</p>
      <p>[268] I hung around another couple of weeks to see what was to come. Everything was changing.</p>
      <p>Sefelt and Fredrickson signed out together Against Medical Advice, and two days later another three</p>
      <p>Acutes  left,  and  six  more  transferred  to  another  ward.  There  was  a  lot  of  investigation  about  the</p>
      <p>party on the ward and about Billy’s death, and the doctor was informed that his resignation would</p>
      <p>be accepted, and he informed them that they would have to go the whole way and can him if they</p>
      <p>wanted him out.</p>
      <p>The Big Nurse was over in Medical for a week, so for a while we had the little Jap nurse from</p>
      <p>Disturbed running the ward; that gave the guys a chance to change a lot of the ward policy. By the</p>
      <p>time  the  Big  Nurse  came  back,  Harding  had  even  got  the  tub  room  back  open  and  was  in  there</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>175</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>dealing  blackjack  himself,  trying  to  make  that  airy,  thin  voice  of  his  sound  like  McMurphy’s</p>
      <p>auctioneer bellow. He was dealing when he heard her key hit the lock.</p>
      <p>We  all  left  the  tub  room  and  came  out  in  the  hall  to  meet  her,  to  ask  about  McMurphy.  She</p>
      <p>jumped back two steps when we approached, and I thought for a second she might run. Her face</p>
      <p>was  bloated  blue  and  out  of  shape  on  one  side,  closing  one  eye  completely,  and  she  had  a  heavy</p>
      <p>bandage around her throat. And a new white uniform. Some of the guys grinned at the front of it; in</p>
      <p>spite of its being smaller and tighter and more starched than her old uniforms, it could no longer</p>
      <p>conceal the fact that she was a woman.</p>
      <p>Smiling, Harding stepped up close and asked what had become of Mack.</p>
      <p>She took a little pad and pencil from the pocket of her uniform and wrote, “He will be back,” on</p>
      <p>it and passed it around. The paper trembled in her hand. “Are you sure?” Harding wanted to know</p>
      <p>after he read it. We’d heard all kinds of things, that he’d knocked down two aides on Disturbed and</p>
      <p>taken  their  keys  and  escaped,  that he’d  been  sent  back  to the  work  farm—even that  the nurse,  in</p>
      <p>charge now till they got a new doctor, was giving him special therapy.</p>
      <p>“Are you quite positive?” Harding repeated.</p>
      <p>The nurse took out her pad again. She was stiff in the joints, and her more than ever white hand</p>
      <p>skittered on the pad like one of those arcade gypsies that scratch out fortunes for a penny. “Yes, Mr.</p>
      <p>Harding,” she wrote. “I would not say so if I was not positive. He will be back.”</p>
      <p>Harding read the paper, then tore it up and threw the pieces at her. She flinched and raised her</p>
      <p>hand to protect the bruised side of her face from the paper. “Lady, I think you’re full of so [269]</p>
      <p>much bullshit,” Harding told her. She stared at him, and her hand wavered over the pad a second,</p>
      <p>but then she turned and walked into the Nurses’ Station, sticking the pad and pencil back down in</p>
      <p>the pocket of her uniform.</p>
      <p>“Hum,” Harding said. “Our conversation was a bit spotty, it seemed. But then, when you are told</p>
      <p>that you are full of bullshit, what kind of written comeback can you make?”</p>
      <p>She  tried  to  get  her  ward  back  into  shape,  but  it  was  difficult  with  McMurphy’s  presence  still</p>
      <p>tromping up and down the halls and laughing out loud in the meetings and singing in the latrines.</p>
      <p>She couldn’t rule with her old power any more, not by writing things on pieces of paper. She was</p>
      <p>losing her patients one after the other. After Harding signed out and was picked up by his wife, and</p>
      <p>George transferred to a different ward, just three of us were left out of the group that had been on</p>
      <p>the fishing crew, myself and Martini and Scanlon.</p>
      <p>I didn’t want to leave just yet, because she seemed to be too sure; she seemed to be waiting for</p>
      <p>one more round, and I wanted to be there in case it came off. And one morning, after McMurphy’d</p>
      <p>been gone three weeks, she made her last play.</p>
      <p>The ward door opened, and the black boys wheeled in this Gurney with a chart at the bottom</p>
      <p>that  said  in  heavy  black  letters,  MCMURPHY,  RANDLE  P.  POST-OPERATIVE.  And  below  this  was</p>
      <p>written in ink, LOBOTOMY.</p>
      <p>They  pushed  it  into  the  day  room  and  left  it  standing  against  the  wall,  along  next  to  the</p>
      <p>Vegetables. We stood at the foot of the Gurney, reading the chart, then looked up to the other end</p>
      <p>at the head dented into the pillow, a swirl of red hair over a face milk-white except for the heavy</p>
      <p>purple bruises around the eyes.</p>
      <p>After a minute of silence Scanlon turned and spat on the floor. “Aaah, what’s the old bitch tryin’</p>
      <p>to put over on us anyhow, for crap sakes. That ain’t him.”</p>
      <p>“Nothing like him,” Martini said.</p>
      <p>“How stupid she think we are?”</p>
      <p>“Oh,  they  done  a  pretty  fair  job,  though,”  Martini  said,  moving  up  alongside  the  head  and</p>
      <p>pointing as he talked. “See. They got the broken nose and that crazy scar—even the sideburns.”</p>
      <p>“Sure,” Scanlon growled, “but hell!”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>176</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>I pushed past the other patients to stand beside Martini. “Sure, they can do things like scars and</p>
      <p>broken noses,” I said. “But they can’t do that look. There’s nothin’ in the face. Just like one of those</p>
      <p>store dummies, ain’t that right, Scanlon?”</p>
      <p>[270]  Scanlon  spat  again.  “Damn  right.  Whole  thing’s,  you  know,  too  blank.  Anybody  can  see</p>
      <p>that.”</p>
      <p>“Look here,” one of the patients said, peeling back the sheet, “tattoos.”</p>
      <p>“Sure,” I said, “they can do tattoos. But the arms, huh? The arms? They couldn’t do those. His</p>
      <p>arms were big!”</p>
      <p>For  the  rest  of  the  afternoon  Scanlon  and  Martini  and  I  ridiculed  what  Scanlon  called  that</p>
      <p>crummy sideshow fake lying there on the Gurney, but as the hours passed and the swelling began</p>
      <p>subsiding around the eyes I saw more and more guys strolling over to look at the figure. I watched</p>
      <p>them  walk  by  acting  like  they  were  going  to  the  magazine  rack  or  the  drinking  fountain,  so  they</p>
      <p>could sneak another look at the face. I watched and tried to figure out what he would have done. I</p>
      <p>was only sure of one thing: he wouldn’t have left something like that sit there in the day room with</p>
      <p>his name tacked on it for twenty or thirty years so the Big Nurse could use it as an example of what</p>
      <p>can happen if you buck the system. I was sure of that.</p>
      <p>I waited that night until the sounds in the dorm told me everybody was asleep, and until the black</p>
      <p>boys had stopped making their rounds. Then I turned my head on the pillow so I could see the bed</p>
      <p>next to mine. I’d been listening to the breathing for hours, since they had wheeled the Gurney in</p>
      <p>and  lifted  the  stretcher  onto  the  bed,  listening  to  the  lungs  stumbling  and  stopping,  then  starting</p>
      <p>again, hoping as I listened they would stop for good—but I hadn’t turned to look yet.</p>
      <p>There was a cold moon at the window, pouring light into the dorm like skim milk. I sat  up in</p>
      <p>bed,  and  my  shadow  fell  across  the  body,  seeming  to  cleave  it  in  half  between  the  hips  and  the</p>
      <p>shoulders, leaving only a black space. The swelling had gone down enough in the eyes that they were</p>
      <p>open; they stared into the full light of the moon, open and undreaming, glazed from being open so</p>
      <p>long  without  blinking  until  they  were  like  smudged  fuses  in  a  fuse  box.  I  moved  to  pick  up  the</p>
      <p>pillow, and the eyes fastened on the movement and followed me as I stood up and crossed the few</p>
      <p>feet between the beds.</p>
      <p>The big, hard body had a tough grip on life. It fought a long time against having it taken away,</p>
      <p>flailing  and  thrashing  around  so  much  I  finally  had  to  lie  full  length  on  top  of  it  and  scissor  the</p>
      <p>kicking legs  with mine while I mashed the pillow into the face. I lay there on top of the body for</p>
      <p>what seemed days. Until the thrashing stopped. Until it was still a while and had shuddered once and</p>
      <p>was still again. Then I rolled off. I lifted the pillow, and in the moonlight I saw the expression hadn’t</p>
      <p>[271]  changed  from  the  blank,  dead-end  look  the  least  bit,  even  under  suffocation.  I  took  my</p>
      <p>thumbs and pushed the lids down and held them till they stayed. Then I lay back on my bed.</p>
      <p>I  lay  for  a  while,  holding  the  covers  over  my  face,  and  thought  I  was  being  pretty  quiet,  but</p>
      <p>Scanlon’s voice hissing from his bed let me know I wasn’t.</p>
      <p>“Take it easy, Chief,” he said. “Take it easy. It’s okay.”</p>
      <p>“Shut up,” I whispered. “Go back to sleep.”</p>
      <p>It was quiet a while; then I heard him hiss again and ask, “Is it finished?”</p>
      <p>I told him yeah.</p>
      <p>“Christ,” he said then, “she’ll know. You realize that, don’t you? Sure, nobody’ll be able to prove</p>
      <p>anything—anybody coulda kicked off in post-operative like he was, happens all the time—but her,</p>
      <p>she’ll know.”</p>
      <p>I didn’t say anything.</p>
      <p>“Was I you, Chief, I’d breeze my tail outa here. Yessir. I tell you what. You leave outa here, and</p>
      <p>I’ll say I saw him up and moving around after you lift and cover you that way. That’s the best idea,</p>
      <p>don’t you think?”</p>
      <empty-line/>
      <p>177</p>
      <p>Ken Kesey   one flew over the cuckoo’s nest</p>
      <p>“Oh, yeah, just like that. Just ask ‘em to unlock the door and let me out.”</p>
      <p>“No. He showed you how one time, if you think back. That very first week. You remember?”</p>
      <p>I didn’t answer him, and be didn’t say anything else, and it was quiet in the dorm again. I lay there</p>
      <p>a few minutes longer and then got up and started putting on my clothes. When I finished dressing I</p>
      <p>reached  into  McMurphy’s  nightstand  and  got  his  cap  and  tried  it  on.  It  was  too  small,  and  I  was</p>
      <p>suddenly ashamed of trying to wear it. I dropped it on Scanlon’s bed as I walked out of the dorm.</p>
      <p>He said, “Take it easy, buddy,” as I walked out.</p>
      <p>The  moon  straining  through  the  screen  of the tub-room  windows  showed the hunched,  heavy</p>
      <p>shape of the control panel, glinted off the chrome fixtures and glass gauges so cold I could almost</p>
      <p>hear the click of it striking. I took a deep breath and bent over and took the levers. I heaved my legs</p>
      <p>under  me  and  felt  the  grind  of  weight  at  my  feet.  I  heaved  again  and  heard  the  wires  and</p>
      <p>connections tearing out of the floor. I lurched it up to my knees and was able, to get an arm around</p>
      <p>it and my other hand under it. The chrome was cold against my neck and the side of my head. I put</p>
      <p>my back  toward the  screen,  then  spun  and  let  the momentum  carry  the  panel through the  Screen</p>
      <p>and  window  with  a  ripping  crash.  The  glass  splashed  out  in  the  moon,  like  a  bright  cold  water</p>
      <p>baptizing  the  sleeping  [272]  earth.  Panting,  I  thought  for  a  second  about  going  back  and  getting</p>
      <p>Scanlon and some of the others, but then I heard the running squeak of the black boys’ shoes in the</p>
      <p>hall and I put my hand on the sill and vaulted after the panel, into the moonlight.</p>
      <p>I ran across the grounds in the direction I remembered seeing the dog go, toward the highway. I</p>
      <p>remember I was taking huge strides as I ran, seeming to step and float a long ways before my next</p>
      <p>foot struck the earth. I felt like I was flying. Free. Nobody bothers coming after an AWOL, I knew,</p>
      <p>and Scanlon could handle any questions about the dead man—no need to be running like this. But I</p>
      <p>didn’t stop. I ran for miles before I stopped and walked up the embankment onto the highway.</p>
      <p>I caught a ride with a guy, a Mexican guy, going north in a truck full of sheep, and gave him such</p>
      <p>a good story about me being a professional Indian wrestler the syndicate had tried to lock up in a</p>
      <p>nuthouse that he stopped real quick and gave me a leather jacket to cover my greens and loaned me</p>
      <p>ten bucks to eat on while I hitchhiked to Canada. I had him write his address down before he drove</p>
      <p>off and I told him I’d send him the money as soon as I got a little ahead.</p>
      <p>I might go to Canada eventually, but I think I’ll stop along the Columbia on the way. I’d like to</p>
      <p>check around Portland and Hood River and The Dalles to see if there’s any of the guys I used to</p>
      <p>know  back  in  the  village  who  haven’t  drunk  themselves  goofy.  I’d  like  to  see  what  they’ve  been</p>
      <p>doing since the government tried to buy their right to be Indians. I’ve even heard that some of the</p>
      <p>tribe  have  took  to  building  their  old  ramshackle  wood  scaffolding  all  over  that  big  million-dollar</p>
      <p>hydroelectric dam, and are spearing salmon in the spillway. I’d give something to see that. Mostly,</p>
      <p>I’d  just  like  to  look over  the  country  around  the  gorge  again,  just  to bring  some of  it  clear  in  my</p>
      <p>mind again.</p>
      <p>I been away a long time.</p>
