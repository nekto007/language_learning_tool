## Example Good Commit

```
Fix test isolation: add UUIDs to email addresses in admin security tests

Problem: Three tests were failing with unique constraint violations
on the users.email field when running multiple times or in parallel.

Root Cause: Tests created users with hardcoded email addresses.

Solution: Added UUID suffixes to all email addresses to ensure
uniqueness across test runs.

Impact: 3 tests fixed (30→27 FAILED)
